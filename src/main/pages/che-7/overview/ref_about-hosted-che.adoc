= About Hosted Che

Hosted{nbsp}Che is link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse{nbsp}Che] hosted by Red{nbsp}Hat.
A Che server is running on OpenShift{nbsp}Dedicated, and the user base is spread across multiple OpenShift{nbsp}Online clusters where workspaces are created.

[id="terms-of-service_{context}"]
== Terms of service

Hosted{nbsp}Che has the following usage limits and terms of service:

* Storage: 1 GB
* RAM: 3 GB
* CPU: 6 Cores
* Concurrent workspaces: 1
* Number of workspaces: Unlimited
* Number of projects per workspace: Unlimited
* Usage time limit: None
* Maximum account inactivity period: 30 days
+
NOTE: Hosted{nbsp}Che automatically deprovisions accounts that have been inactive for more than 30 days. All existing workspaces in a deprovisioned account are lost. To start using Hosted{nbsp}Che again, a user must re-register.

* Workspace idling time: 15 minutes
+
NOTE: A started workspace can be used for an unlimited period of time. When there are no interactions with the IDE, the workspace is stopped after 15 minutes.

* Ephemeral mode: Defaults to *Active*
+
NOTE: In ephemeral mode, workspaces have no persistent storage attached. All content changes are lost when the workspace is stopped unless they are pushed to a source-code repository first. This is done to improve the performance of workspace starts and file-system operations in the IDE.

It is possible to disable ephemeral mode while xref:creating-a-worskpace-from-the-user-dashboard_hosted-che[creating a workspace from the user dashboard]. For more information about ephemeral mode, including how to disable it after workspace creation, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/workspaces-overview[Using developer environments - workspaces].
