= Workspace namespaces configuration

The Kubernetes namespace where a new workspace pod is deployed depends on the Che server configuration. By default, every workspace is deployed in a distinct namespace, but the user can configure the Che server to deploy all workspaces in one specific namespace. The name of a namespace must be provided as a Che server configuration property and cannot be changed at runtime.
