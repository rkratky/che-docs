The Che workspace is a web application. It is composed of microservices running in containers that provide all the services of a modern IDE (an editor, language auto-completion, debugging tooling). The IDE services are deployed with the development tooling, packaged in containers and user runtime applications, which are defined as Kubernetes resources.

The source code of the projects of a Che workspace is persisted in a Kubernetes `PersistentVolume`. Microservices run in containers that have read-write access to the source code (IDE services, development tools), and runtime applications have read-write access to this shared directory.

The following diagram shows the detailed components of a Che workspace.

In the diagram, there are three running workspaces: two belonging to *User A* and one to *User C*. A fourth workspace is getting provisioned where the plug-in broker is verifying and completing the workspace configuration.

Use the devfile format to specify the tools and runtime applications of a Che workspace.
