= Persistent volume configuration

A Kubernetes persistent volume is attached to the Che workspace to persist its data: source code, application logs, and tools configuration. A Che server can be configured to use different strategies:

* *common*: A Che workspace that is provisioned in the same Kubernetes namespace and shares the same `PersistentVolume`. The data of different workspaces are separated using subpaths. The default strategy is *common*.

* *unique*: Every Che workspace is attached to a distinct persistent volume. This strategy provides better data isolation but requires more resources.
