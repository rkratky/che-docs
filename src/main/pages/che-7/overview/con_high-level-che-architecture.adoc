At a high-level, Che is composed of one central workspace controller that manages the Che workspaces through the Kubernetes API.

When Che is installed on a Kubernetes cluster, the workspace controller is the only component that is deployed. A Che workspace is created immediately after a user requests it.

This section describes the different services that create the workspaces controller and the Che workspaces.
