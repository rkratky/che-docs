= Che workspace JWT proxy

The JWT proxy is responsible for securing the communication of the Che workspace services. The Che workspace JWT proxy is included in a Che workspace only if the Che server is configured in multi-user mode.

An HTTP proxy is used to sign outgoing requests from a workspace service to the Che server and to authenticate incoming requests from the IDE client running on a browser.
