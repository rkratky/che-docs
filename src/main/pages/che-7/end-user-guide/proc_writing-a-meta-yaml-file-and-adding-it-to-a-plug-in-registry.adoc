= Writing a meta.yaml file and adding it to a plug-in registry

The plug-in meta information is required to publish a VS Code extension in an Eclipse Che plug-in registry. This meta information is provided as a `meta.yaml` file. This section describes how to create a `meta.yaml` file for an extension.

.Procedure

. Create a `meta.yaml` file in the following plug-in registry directory: `__<apiVersion>__/plugins/__<publisher>__/__<plug-inName>__/__<plug-inVersion>__/`.
+
// NOTE: Support of two or more extensions is broken. See the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13578[GitHub description for this issue] for further information.

. Edit the `meta.yaml` file and provide the necessary information. The configuration file must adhere to the following structure:
