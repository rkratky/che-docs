The Che-Theia IDE allows users to define custom commands in a devfile that are then available when working in a workspace.

The following is an example of the `commands` section of a devfile.

[source,yaml]
----
commands:
- name: theia:build
  actions:
  - type: exec
    component: che-dev
    command: >
              yarn
    workdir: /projects/theia
- name: run
  actions:
  - type: vscode-task
    referenceContent: |
            {
             "version": "2.0.0",
             "tasks":
             [
              {
               "label": "theia:watch",
                "type": "shell",
                "options": {"cwd": "/projects/theia"},
                "command": "yarn",
                "args": ["watch"]
              }
             ]
            }
- name: debug
  actions:
  - type: vscode-launch
    referenceContent: |
            {
             "version": "0.2.0",
             "configurations": [
              {
               "type": "node",
               "request": "attach",
               "name": "Attach by Process ID",
               "processId": "${command:PickProcess}"
              }
             ]
            }

* The `exec` type implies that the Che runner is used for command execution. The user can specify the component in whose container the command is executed.
* The `command` field contains the command line for execution.
* The `workdir` is the working directory in which the command is executed.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) tasks:: `run`
+
* The type is `vscode-task`.
* For this type of command, the `referenceContent` field must contain content with task configurations in the VS Code format.
* For more information about VS Code tasks, see the Task section on the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks[Visual Studio User Guide page].

VS Code launch configurations:: `debug`
+
