= Devfile reference

This section contains devfile reference and instructions on how to use the various elements that devfiles consist of.


== Adding projects to a devfile

In most cases, a devfile contains one or more projects. A workspace is created to develop those projects. Projects are added in the `projects` section of devfiles.

Each project in a single devfile must have:

* Unique name
* Source specified

Project source consists of two mandatory values: `type` and `location`.

`type`:: The kind of project-source provider.
`location`:: The URL of project source.

Che supports the following project types:

`git`:: Projects with sources in Git. The location points to a clone link.

`github`:: Same as `git` but for projects hosted on link:https://github.com/[GitHub] only. Use `git` for projects that do not use GitHub-specific features.

`zip`:: Projects with sources in a ZIP archive. Location points to a ZIP file.


=== Project-source type: git

[source,yaml]
----
source:
    type: git
    location: https://github.com/eclipse/che.git
    startPoint: master           <1>
    tag: 7.2.0
    commitId: 36fe587
    branch: master
    sparseCheckoutDir: wsmaster  <2>
----
<1> `startPoint` is the general value for `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch`. The `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch` parameters are mutually exclusive. When more than one is supplied, the following order is used: `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, `branch`.
<2> `sparseCheckoutDir` the template for the sparse checkout Git feature. This is useful when only a part of a project (typically only a single directory) is needed.

.`sparseCheckoutDir` parameter settings
====
* Set to `/my-module/` to create only the root `my-module` directory (and its content).

* Omit the leading slash (`my-module/`) to create all `my-module` directories that exist in the project. Including, for example, `/addons/my-module/`.
+
The trailing slash indicates that only directories with the given name (including their content) should be created.

* Use wildcards to specify more than one directory name. For example, setting `module-*` checks out all directories of the given project that start with `module-`.
====

For more information, see link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-read-tree#_sparse_checkout[Sparse checkout in Git documentation].


=== Project-source type: zip

[source,yaml]
----
source:
    type: zip
    location: http://host.net/path/project-src.zip
----


=== Project clone-path parameter: clonePath

The `clonePath` parameter specifies the path into which the project is to be cloned. The path must be relative to the `/projects/` directory, and it cannot leave the `/projects/` directory. The default value is the project name.

----

See <<adding-components-to-a-devfile_{context}>> for instructions on how to add tooling to a devfile.


[id="adding-components-to-a-devfile_{context}"]
== Adding components to a devfile

Each component in a single devfile must have a unique name.

=== Component type: cheEditor

Describes the editor used in the workspace by defining its `id`. A devfile can only contain one component of the `cheEditor` type.

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  - alias: theia-editor
    type: cheEditor
    id: eclipse/che-theia/next
----

When `cheEditor` is missing, a default editor is provided along with its default plug-ins. The default plug-ins are also provided for an explicitly defined editor with the same `id` as the default one (even if it is a different version). Che-Theia is configured as default editor along with the *Che Machine Exec* plug-in.

To specify that a workspace requires no editor, use the xref:attribute-editorfree_{context}[`editorFree:true` attribute] in the devfile attributes.

=== Component type: chePlugin

Describes plug-ins in a workspace by defining their `id`. It is allowed to have several `chePlugin` components.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
----

Both types above using id, which is slash-separated publisher, name and version of plugin from Che Plugin registry. +
List of available Che plugins and more information about registry can be found in the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry[Che plug-in registry] GitHub repository.

=== Specifying an alternative component registry

To specify an alternative registry for the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, use the `registryUrl` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     registryUrl: https://my-customregistry.com
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
----

=== Specifying a component by linking to its descriptor

An alternative way of specifying `cheEditor` or `chePlugin`, instead of using the editor or plug-in `id` (and optionally an alternative registry), is to provide a direct link to the component descriptor (typically named `meta.yaml`) by using the `reference` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com.../plugin/1.0.1/meta.yaml
----

NOTE: It is not possible to mix the `id` and `reference` fields in a single component definition; they are mutually exclusive.

=== Specifying container memory limit for components

To specify a container(s) memory limit for `cheEditor` or `chePlugin`, use the `memoryLimit` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/0.0.1
     memoryLimit: 256M
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

=== Tuning component configuration

A component may need to be precisely tuned, and in such case, component preferences can be used. The example shows how to configure JVM using plug-in preferences.

[source,yaml]
----
  id: redhat/java/0.38.0
  type: chePlugin
  preferences:
     java.jdt.ls.vmargs: '-noverify -Xmx1G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication'
----


=== Component type: kubernetes

A complex component type that allows to apply configuration from a Kubernetes or OpenShift lists. The content of the component can be provided either via the `reference` attribute, which points to the file with the component content.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
        app.kubernetes.io/component: database
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: petclinic
----

Alternatively, to post a devfile with such components to REST API, the contents of the Kubernetes or OpenShift list can be embedded into the devfile using the `referenceContent` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      referenceContent: |
           kind: List
           items:
            -
             apiVersion: v1
             kind: Pod
             metadata:
              name: ws
             spec:
              containers:
              ... etc
----

As with the xref:component-type-dockerimage_{context}[`dockerimage` component], it is possible to override the entrypoint of the containers contained in the Kubernetes or OpenShift list using the `command` and `args` properties (as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes[understood] by Kubernetes).

There can be more containers in the list (contained in pods or pod templates of deployments). To select which containers to apply the entrypoint changes to.

The entrypoints can be defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: appDeployment
      type: kubernetes
      reference: app-deployment.yaml
      entrypoints:
      - parentName: mysqlServer
        command: ['sleep']
        args: ['infinity']
      - parentSelector:
          app: prometheus
        args: ['-f', '/opt/app/prometheus-config.yaml']
----

The `entrypoints` list contains constraints for picking the containers along with the `command` and `args` parameters to apply to them. In the example above, the constraint is `parentName: mysqlServer`, which will cause the command to be applied to all containers defined in any parent object called `mysqlServer`. The parent object is assumed to be a top level object in the list defined in the referenced file, which is `app-deployment.yaml` in the example above.

Other types of constraints (and their combinations) are possible:

`containerName`:: the name of the container
`parentName`:: the name of the parent object that (indirectly) contains the containers to override
`parentSelector`:: the set of labels the parent object needs to have

A combination of these constraints can be used to precisely locate the containers inside the referenced Kubernetes list.

=== Specifying mount sources option

To specify a project sources directory mount into container(s), use the `mountSources` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
   components:
      - alias: appDeployment
        type: kubernetes
        reference: app-deployment.yaml
        mountSources: true
----

If enabled, project sources mounts will be applied to every container of the given component.
This parameter is also applicable for `chePlugin` type components.

[id="component-type-dockerimage_{context}"]
=== Component type: dockerimage

A component type that allows to define a container image-based configuration of a container in a workspace. A devfile can only contain one component of the `dockerimage` type. The `dockerimage` type of component brings in custom tooling into the workspace. The component is identified by its image.

[source,yaml]
----
 components:
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: eclipe/maven-jdk8:latest
     volumes:
       - name: mavenrepo
         containerPath: /root/.m2
     env:
       - name: ENV_VAR
         value: value
     endpoints:
       - name: maven-server
         port: 3101
         attributes:
           protocol: http
           secure: 'true'
           public: 'true'
           discoverable: 'false'
     memoryLimit: 1536M
     command: ['tail']
     args: ['-f', '/dev/null']
----

*Example of a minimal `dockerimage` component*

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
    name: MyDevfile
components:
type: dockerimage
image: golang
memoryLimit: 512Mi
command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----

It specifies the type of the component, `dockerimage` and the `image` attribute names the image to be used for the component using the usual docker naming conventions, that is, the above `type` attribute is equal to `docker.io/library/golang:latest`.

A `dockerimage` component has many features that enable augmenting the image with additional resources and information needed for meaningful integration of the *tool* provided by the image with Eclipse Che.

==== Mounting project sources

For the `dockerimage` component to have access to the project sources, you must set the `mountSources` attribute to `true`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
    name: MyDevfile
components:
type: dockerimage
image: golang
memoryLimit: 512Mi
mountSources: true
command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----

The sources is mounted on a location stored in the `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable that is made available in the running container of the image. This location defaults to `/projects`.

==== Container Entrypoint

The `command` attribute of the `dockerimage` along with other arguments, is used to modify the `entrypoint` command of the container created from the image. In Eclipse Che the container is needed to run indefinitely so that you can connect to it and execute arbitrary commands in it at any time. Because the availability of the `sleep` command and the support for the `infinity` argument for it is different and depends on the base image used in the particular images, Che cannot insert this behavior automatically on its own. However, you can take advantage of this feature to, for example, start up necessary servers with modified configurations, etc.

==== Persistent Storage

Docker image tools can specify the custom volumes to be mounted on specific locations within the image. Note that the volume names are shared across all components and therefore this mechanism can also be used to share file systems between components.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    volumes:
      - name: cache
        containerPath: /.cache
----

==== Environment

Eclipse Che allows you to configure Docker containers by modifying the environment variables available in the container of an image.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
      - name: GOCACHE
        value: /tmp/go-cache
----

[NOTE]
====
* The variable expansion works between the environment variables, and it uses the Kubernetes convention for the variable references.

* The predefined variables are available for use in custom definitions.
====

The following environment variables are pre-set by the Che server:

* `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT`: The location of the projects directory (note that if the component does not mount the sources, the projects will not be accessible).

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_LOGS_ROOT__DIR`: The location of the logs common to all the components. If the component chooses to put logs into this directory, the log files are accessible from all other components.

* `CHE_API_INTERNAL`: The URL to the Che server API endpoint used for communication with the Che server.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_ID`: The ID of the current workspace.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_NAME`: The name of the current workspace.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE`: The namespace of the current workspace.

* `CHE_MACHINE_TOKEN`: The token used to authenticate the request against the Che server.

* `CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__PUBLIC__KEY`: The public key used to secure the communication with the Che server.

* `CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__ALGORITHM`: The encryption algorithm used in the secured communication with the Che server.

A devfiles may only need the `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable to locate the cloned projects in the component's container. More advanced devfiles might use the `CHE_WORKSPACE_LOGS_ROOT__DIR` environment variable to read the logs (for example as part of a devfile command). The environment variables used to securely access the Che server are mostly out of scope for devfiles and are present only for advanced use cases that are usually handled by the Che plug-ins.

==== Endpoints

You can specify the endpoints that the docker image exposes. These endpoints can be made accessible to the users if the Che cluster is running using a Kubernetes ingress or an OpenShift route and to the other components within the workspace. You can create an endpoint for your application or database, if your application or database server is listening on a port and you want to be able to directly interact with it yourself or you want other components to interact with it.

Endpoints have a number of properties as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
      - name: GOCACHE
        value: /tmp/go-cache
    endpoints:
     - name: web
       port: 8080
       attributes:
         discoverable: false
         public: true
         protocol: http
  - type: dockerimage
    image: postgres
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    env:
      - name: POSTGRES_USER
        value: user
      - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
        value: password
      - name: POSTGRES_DB
        value: database
    endpoints:
      - name: postgres
        port: 5432
        attributes:
          discoverable: true
          public: false
----

Here, there are two dockerimages, each defining a single endpoint. Endpoint is an accessible port that can be made accessible inside the workspace or also publicly (example, from the UI). Each endpoint has a name and port, which is the port on which certain server running inside the container is listening. The following are a few attributes that you can set on the endpoint:

* `discoverable`: If an endpoint is discoverable, it means that it can be accessed using its name as the hostname within the workspace containers (in the Kubernetes parlance, a service is created for it with the provided name).

* `public`: The endpoint will be accessible outside of the workspace, too (such endpoint can be accessed from the Che user interface). Such endpoints are publicized always on port `80` or `443` (depending on whether `tls` is enabled in Che).

* `protocol`: For public endpoints the protocol is a hint to the UI on how to construct the URL for the endpoint access. Typical values are `http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`.

* `secure`: A boolean (defaulting to `false`) specifying whether the endpoint is put behind a JWT proxy requiring a JWT workspace token to grant access.

* `path`: The URL of the endpoint

* `unsecuredPaths`: A comma-separated list of paths in the endpoint that should not be secured, even if the `secure` attribute is set to `true`

* `cookiesAuthEnabled`: When set to `true` (the default is `false`), the JWT workspace token is automatically fetched and included in a workspace-specific cookie to allow requests to pass through the JWT proxy.
+
WARNING: This setting potentially allows a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF] attack when used in conjunction with a server using POST requests.

When starting a new server within a component, Che autodetects this, and the UI offers to automatically expose this port as a `public` port. This is useful for debugging a web application, for example. It is not possible to do this for servers that autostart with the container (for example, a database server). For such components, specify the endpoints explicitly.

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift resources

Complex deployments can be described using Kubernetes or OpenShift resource lists that can be referenced in the devfile. This makes them a part of the workspace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because a Che workspace is internally represented as a single deployment, all resources from the Kubernetes or OpenShift list are merged into that single deployment.

* Be careful when designing such lists because this can result in name conflicts and other problems.

* Only the following subset of the Kubernetes objects are supported: `deployments`, `pods`, `services`, `persistent volume claims`, `secrets`, and `config maps`. Kubernetes Ingresses are ignored, but OpenShift routes are supported. A workspace created from a devfile using any other object types fails to start.

* When running Che on a Kubernetes cluster, only Kubernetes lists are supported. When running Che on an OpenShift cluster, both Kubernetes and OpenShift lists are supported.
====

----

The preceding component references a file that is relative to the location of the devfile itself. Meaning, this devfile is only loadable by a Che factory to which you supply the location of the devfile and therefore it is able to figure out the location of the referenced Kubernetes resource list.

The following is an example of the `postgres.yaml` file.

For a basic example of a devfile with an associated Kubernetes or OpenShift list, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile/tree/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample[web-nodejs-with-db-sample] on redhat-developer GitHub.

If you use generic or large resource lists from which you will only need a subset of resources, you can select particular resources from the list using a selector (which, as the usual Kubernetes selectors, works on the labels of the resources in the list).

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0

components:
  - type: kubernetes
    reference: ../relative/path/postgres.yaml
    selector:
      app: postgres
----

Additionally, it is also possible to modify the entrypoints (command and arguments) of the containers present in the resource list. For details of the advanced use case, see the reference (TODO: link).

== Adding commands to a devfile

A devfile allows to specify commands to be available for execution in a workspace. Every command can contain a subset of actions, which are related to a specific component in whose container it will be executed.

[source,yaml]
----
 commands:
   - name: build
     actions:
       - type: exec
         component: mysql
         command: mvn clean
         workdir: /projects/spring-petclinic
----

You can use commands to automate the workspace. You can define commands for building and testing your code, or cleaning the database.

The following are two kinds of commands:

* Che specific commands: You have full control over what component executes the command.

* Editor specific commands: You can use the editor-specific command definitions (example: `tasks.json` and `launch.json` in Theia, which is equivalent to how these files work in VS Code).

=== Che-specific commands

Each che-specific command has an *action* attribute that is a command to execute and a *component* attribute that specifies the container in which the command should be executed. The commands are run using the default shell in the container.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    alias: go-cli
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
      - name: GOCACHE
        value: /tmp/go-cache
commands:
  - name: compile and run
    actions:
     - type: exec
       component: go-cli
       command: “go get -d && go run main.go”
       workdir: “${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project”
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* If a component to be used in a command must have an alias. This alias is used to reference the component in the command definition. Example: `alias: go-cli` in the component definition and `component: go-cli` in the command definition. This ensures that Eclipse Che can find the correct container to run the command in.

* A command can have only one action.
====

=== Editor-specific commands

If the editor in the workspace supports it, the devfile can specify additional configuration in the editor-specific format. This is dependent on the integration code present in the workspace editor itself and so is not a generic mechanism. However, the default Theia editor within Eclipse Che is equipped to understand the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files provided in the devfile.

This example shows association of a `tasks.json` file with a devfile. Notice the `vscode-task` type that instructs the Che-Theia editor to interpret this command as a tasks definition and `referenceContent` attribute that contains the contents of the file itself. You can also save this file separately from the devfile and use `reference` attribute to specify a relative or absolute URL to it.

In addition to the `vscode-task` commands, the Che-Theia editor understands `vscode-launch` type using which you can specify the launch configurations.

=== Command preview URL

WARNING: This is a Beta feature. Definition may change in future releases without any warning. It's available in devfile version `1.0.1-beta`.

It is possible to specify a preview URL for commands that expose web UI. This URL is offered for opening when the command is executed.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.1-beta

commands:
    - name: tasks
      previewUrl:
        port: 8080     <1>
        path: /myweb   <2>
      actions:
      - type: exec
        component: go-cli
        command: "go run webserver.go"
        workdir: ${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/webserver
----
<1> TCP port where the application listens. Mandatory parameter.
<2> The path part of the URL to the UI. Optional parameter. The default is root (`/`).

The example above opens `++http://__<server-domain>__/myweb++`, where `_<server-domain>_` is the URL to the dynamically created Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route.

== Devfile attributes

Devfile attributes can be used to configure various features.

[id="attribute-editorfree_{context}"]
=== Attribute: editorFree

When an editor is not specified in a devfile, a default is provided. When no editor is needed, the `editorFree` attribute should be used. The default value is `false`, and it means that the devfile needs the default editor to be provisioned.

metadata:
  name: petclinic-dev-environment
components:
  - alias: myApp
    type: kubernetes
    local: my-app.yaml
attributes:
  editorFree: true
----

=== Attribute: persistVolumes (ephemeral mode)

By default, volumes and PVCs specified in a devfile are bound to a host folder to persist data even after a container restart. Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable data persistence, such as when volume backend is slow, and it is needed to make workspace faster. To achieve it, the `persistVolumes` devfile attribute should be used. The default value is `true`, and in case of `false`, `emptyDir` volumes will be used for configured volumes and PVC.
