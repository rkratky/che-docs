= Including a Kubernetes application in a workspace devfile definition

This procedure demonstrates how to define the Che 7 workspace devfile by Kubernetes application.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of Eclipse Che. To install an instance of Eclipse Che, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[Che 'quick-starts'].

* `chectl` management tool is installed. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/installing-the-chectl-management-tool/[Installing the `chectl` management tool]

// TO DO Supply URL for that file location
The devfile format is used to define a Che workspace, and its format is described in the link:#making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile_using-developer-environments-workspaces[Making a workspace portable using a devfile] section. The following is an example of the simplest devfile:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
 name: minimal-workspace
----

Only the name (*minimal-workspace*) is specified. After the Che server processes this devfile, the devfile is converted to a minimal Che workspace that only has the default editor (Che-Theia) and the default editor plug-ins (example: the terminal).

Use the `Kubernetes` type of components in the devfile to add Kubernetes applications to a workspace.

For example, the user can embed the `NodeJS-Mongo` application in the minimal-workspace defined in this paragraph by adding a `components` section.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
 name: minimal-workspace
components:
 - type: kubernetes
   reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../mongo-db.yaml
 - alias: nodejs-app
   type: kubernetes
   reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../nodejs-app.yaml
   entrypoints:
     - command: ['sleep']
       args: ['infinity']
----

Note that the `sleep infinity` command is added as the entrypoint of the Node.js application. This prevents the application from starting at the workspace start phase. It allows the user to start it when needed for testing or debugging purposes.

To make it easier for a developer to test the application, add the commands in the devfile:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
 name: minimal-workspace
components:
 - type: kubernetes
   reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../mongo-db.yaml
 - alias: nodejs-app
   type: kubernetes
   reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../nodejs-app.yaml
   entrypoints:
     - command: ['sleep']
       args: ['infinity']
commands:
 - name: run
   actions:
     - type: exec
       component: nodejs-app
       command: cd ${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/nodejs-mongo-app/EmployeeDB/ && npm install && sed -i -- ''s/localhost/mongo/g'' app.js && node app.js
----

Use this devfile to create and start a workspace with the `chectl` command:

[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ chectl worspace:start --devfile _<devfile-path>_
----

The `run` command added to the devfile is available as a task in Che-Theia from the command palette. When executed, the command starts the NodeJS application.
