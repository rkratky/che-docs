= Choosing the sidecar image

Che plug-ins are special services that extend the Che workspace capabilities. Che plug-ins are packaged as containers. The containers that the plug-ins are packaged into run as _sidecars_ of the Che workspace editor and augment its capabilities.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of Eclipse Che. To install an instance of Eclipse Che, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[Che 'quick-starts'].

.Procedure

To choose a sidecar image:

. If the VS code extension does not have any external dependencies, use `eclipse/che-theia-endpoint-runtime: next` as a sidecar container image for the extension.
+
[NOTE]
====
In addition to the `eclipse/che-theia-endpoint-runtime:next` base image, the following ready-to-use sidecar images that include language-specific dependencies are available:

* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-runner-java8
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-runner-java11
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-go-1.10.7
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-python-3.7.3
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-dotnet-2.2.105
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-php7
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-kubernetes-tooling-1.0.0
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-kubernetes-tooling-0.1.17
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-openshift-connector-0.0.17
* eclipse/che-remote-plugin-openshift-connector-0.0.21
====

. If a VS Code extension has external dependencies that are not found in one of the ready-to-use images, use a container image that contains the needed dependencies for the extension and is based on the `eclipse/che-theia-endpoint-runtime:next` image.
+
Example: The `FROM` directive should be similar to `FROM eclipse/che-theia-endpoint-runtime:next`. This is required because this base image contains tools for running the remote VS Code extension and communications between the sidecar and the Che-Theia editor, so that the VS Code extension does not have to know that it is a remote one.
