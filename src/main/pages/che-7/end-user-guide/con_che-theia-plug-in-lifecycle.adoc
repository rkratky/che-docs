= Che-Theia plug-in lifecycle

When a user is starting a workspace, the following procedure is followed:

. Che master checks for plug-ins to start from the workspace definition.
. Plug-in metadata is retrieved, and the type of each plug-in is recognized.
. A broker is selected according to the plug-in type.
. The broker processes the installation and deployment of the plug-in (the installation process is different for each broker).

NOTE: There are different types of plug-ins. A broker ensures all installation requirements are met for a plug-in to deploy correctly.

Before a Che workspace is launched, Che master starts containers for the workspace:

. The Che-Theia plug-in broker extracts the plug-in (from the `.theia` file) to get the sidecar containers that the plug-in needs.
. The broker sends the appropriate container informations to Che master.
. The broker copies the Che-Theia plug-in to a volume to have it available for the Che-Theia editor container.
. Che workspace master then starts all the containers of the workspace.
. Che-Theia is started in its own container and checks the correct folder to load the plug-ins.

Che-Theia plug-in lifecycle:

. When a user is opening a browser tab or window with Che-Theia, Che-Theia starts a new plug-in session (browser or remote *TODO: 'what is _remote_ in this context?'*). Every Che-Theia plug-in is notified that a new session has been started (the `start()` function of the plug-in triggered).
. A Che-Theia plug-in session is running and interacting with the Che-Theia backend and frontend.
. When the user is closing the browser tab or there is a timeout, every plug-in is notified (the `stop()` function of the plug-in triggered).
