This section describes some of the most frequent issues with the Che-Theia IDE.

Che-Theia shows a notification with the following message: `Plugin runtime crashed unexpectedly, all plugins are not working, please reload the page. Probably there is not enough memory for the plugins.`::

  This means that one of the Che-Theia plug-ins that are running in the Che-Theia IDE container requires more memory than the container has. To fix this problem, increase the amount of memory for the Che-Theia IDE container:

  . Navigate to the Che Dashboard.
  . Select the workspace in which the problem happened.
  . Switch to the *Devfile* tab.
  . In the `components` section of the devfile, find a component of the `cheEditor` type.
  . Add a new property, `memoryLimit: 1024M` (or increase the value if it already exists).
  . Save changes and restart the workspace.
