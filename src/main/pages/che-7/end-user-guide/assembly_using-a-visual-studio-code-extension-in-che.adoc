Starting with Eclipse Che 7, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions can be installed to extend the functionality of a Che workspace. VS Code extensions can run in the Che-Theia editor container, or they can be packaged in their own isolated and pre-configured containers with their prerequisites.

This document describes:

* Use of a VS Code extension in Che with workspaces
* Che Plug-ins panel
* How to publish a VS Code extension in the Che plug-in registry (to share the extension with other Che users)
+
** The extension-hosting sidecar container and the use of the extension in a devfile are optional for this.
** How to review the compatibility of the VS Code extensions to be informed whether a specific API is supported or has not been implemented yet.
