= Che-Theia task types

There are two types of tasks in a devfile: tasks in the VS Code format and Che commands. Tasks from the devfile are copied to the configuration file when the workspace is started. Depending on the type of the task, the task is then available for running:

* Che commands: From the *Terminal* -> *Run Task* menu in the *configured tasks* section, or from the *My Workspace* panel

* Tasks in the VS Code format: From the *Run Tasks* menu

To run the task definitions provided by plug-ins, select the *Terminal* -> *Run Task* menu option. The tasks are placed in the *detected tasks* section.
