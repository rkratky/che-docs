This document covers all aspects of user authentication in Eclipse Che, both on the Che server and in workspaces. This includes securing all REST API endpoints, WebSocket or JSON RPC connections, and some web resources.

All authentication types use the link:https://jwt.io/introduction/[JWT open standard] as a container for transferring user identity information. In addition, Che server authentication is based on the link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] protocol implementation, which is provided by default by link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak].

Authentication in workspaces implies the issuance of self-signed per-workspace JWT tokens and their verification on a dedicated service based on link:https://www.keycloak.org/[JWTProxy].
