= Extending Che monitoring metrics

There are two major modules for metrics:

* `che-core-metrics-core` -- contains core metrics module
* `che-core-api-metrics` -- contains metrics that are dependent on core Che components, such as workspace or user managers


.Procedure

To create a metric or a group of metrics, you need a class that extends the `MeterBinder` class. This allows to register the created metric in the overriden `bindTo(MeterRegistry registry)` method.

The following is an example of a metric that has a function that supplies the value for it:

.Example metric
[source,java]
----
public class UserMeterBinder implements MeterBinder {

  private final UserManager userManager;

  @Inject
  public UserMeterBinder(UserManager userManager) {
    this.userManager = userManager;
  }

  @Override
  public void bindTo(MeterRegistry registry) {
    Gauge.builder("che.user.total", this::count)
        .description("Total amount of users")
        .register(registry);
  }

  private double count() {
    try {
      return userManager.getTotalCount();
    } catch (ServerException e) {
      return Double.NaN;
    }
  }
----

Alternatively, the metric can be stored with a reference and updated manually in some other place in the code.
