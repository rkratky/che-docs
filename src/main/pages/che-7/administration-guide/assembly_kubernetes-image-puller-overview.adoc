A bottleneck of starting an Eclipse Che workspace can be pulling images. Pre-pulling images can greatly improve startup time. The Kubernetes Image Puller can be used to pre-pull images and speed up workspace startup time.

The Kubernetes Image Puller is an additional deployment that runs alongside Eclipse Che. Given a list of images to pre-pull, the application is runs inside a cluster and creates a Daemonset that pulls the images on each node.

The application can be deployed via Helm or by processing and applying OpenShift Templates.

The Kubernetes Image Puller pulls its configuration from a `ConfigMap` with the following available parameters:

[#configuration]
|=========
|Parameter	|Usage	|Default
|`CACHING_INTERVAL_HOURS` |Interval, in hours, between checking health of daemonsets |`"1"`
|`CACHING_MEMORY_REQUEST`	|The memory request for each cached image when the puller is running	|`10Mi`
|`CACHING_MEMORY_LIMIT`	|The memory limit for each cached image when the puller is running	|`20Mi`
|`DAEMONSET_NAME`	|Name of daemonset to be created	|`kubernetes-image-puller`
|`NAMESPACE`	|Namespace where daemonset is to be created	|`k8s-image-puller`
|`IMAGES`	|List of images to be cached, in the format `<name>=<image>;...`	|Contains a default list of images, but should be configured when deploying
|`NODE_SELECTOR`	|Node selector applied to pods created by the daemonset	|`'{}'`
