= Adding a new devfile

The `devfiles/` directory contains the devfiles. Every devfile directory has the following structure:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
./che-devfile-registry/devfiles
 ├── _<stack-name>_
 ├── devfile.yaml
 └── meta.yaml
----

To add a new devfile:

.Procedure

. In the `devfiles/` directory, create a new subdirectory `__<stack-name>__/`.

. In this new subdirectory, add a new plug-in `devfile.yaml` file and a `meta.yaml` file. The following is an example `my-stack/` directory, and it contains a `devfile.yaml` file and a `meta.yaml` file:
+
----
$ mkdir -p che-devfile-registry/devfiles/my-devfile
$ touch che-devfile-registry/devfiles/my-devfile/devfile.yaml
$ touch che-devfile-registry/devfiles/my-devfile/meta.yaml
$ tree ./che-devfile-registry/devfiles
./che-devfile-registry/devfiles
 ├── my-devfile
 ├── devfile.yaml
 └── meta.yaml
----

. Add valid content in the `devfile.yaml` file. For a detailed description of the devfile format, see the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile[Making a workspace portable using a Devfile] section.

. Ensure that the `meta.yaml` file conforms to the following structure:
+
