.Prerequisites

The `my-plugin-registry` and `my-devfile-registry` images used in this section are built using the `docker` command. This section assumes that these images are available on the Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster where Che is deployed.

This is true on Minishift or Minikube, for example, if before running the `docker build` commands, the user executed the `eval $\{minikube docker-env}` command (or, the `eval $\{minishift docker-env}` command for Minishift).

Otherwise, these images can be pushed to a container registry (public, such as `quay.io`, or the DockerHub, or a private registry).
