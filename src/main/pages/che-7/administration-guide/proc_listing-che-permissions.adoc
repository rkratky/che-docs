[id="listing-che-permissions_{context}"]
= Listing Che permissions

To list Che permissions that apply to a specific *resource*, perform the `GET /permissions` request.

To list the permissions that apply to a *user*, perform the `GET /permissions/{domain}` request.

To list the permissions that apply to *all users*, perform the `GET /permissions/{domain}/all`  request. The user must have *manageSystem* permissions to see this information. 

The suitable domain values are:

* system
* organization
* workspace

NOTE: The domain is optional. If no domain is specified, the API returns all possible permissions for all the domains.
