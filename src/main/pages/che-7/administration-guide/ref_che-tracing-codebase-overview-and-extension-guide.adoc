= Che tracing codebase overview and extension guide

The core of the tracing implementation for Che is in the `che-core-tracing-core` and `che-core-tracing-web` modules.

All HTTP requests to the tracing API have their own trace. This is done by `TracingFilter` from the link:https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-web-servlet-filter[OpenTracing library], which is bound for the whole server application. Adding a `@Traced` annotation to methods causes the `TracingInterceptor` to add tracing spans for them.

== Tagging

Spans may contain standard tags, such as operation name, span origin, error, as well as others that may help users with querying and filtering spans. Workspace-related operations (such as starting or stopping workspaces) have additional tags, including `userId`, `workspaceId`, and `stackId`. Spans created by `TracingFilter` also have an HTTP status code tag.

Declaring tags in a traced method is done statically by setting fields from the `TracingTags` class:

[source,java]
----
TracingTags.WORKSPACE_ID.set(workspace.getId());
----

`TracingTags` is a class where all commonly used tags are declared, as respective `AnnotationAware` tag implementations.
