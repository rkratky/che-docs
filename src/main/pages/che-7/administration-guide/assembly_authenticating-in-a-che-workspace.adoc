= Authenticating in a Che workspace

:context: authenticating-in-a-che-workspace

Workspace containers may contain services that must be protected with authentication. Such protected services are called *secure*. For this purpose, a machine authentication mechanism should be used. Machine tokens avoid the need to pass Keycloak tokens to workspace containers (which can be insecure). Also, Keycloak tokens may have a relatively shorter lifetime and require periodic renewals or refreshes, which is difficult to manage and keep in sync with the same user session tokens on clients.
