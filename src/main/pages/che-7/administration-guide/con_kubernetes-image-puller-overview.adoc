= Kubernetes Image Puller overview

Slow starts of {prod} workspaces may be caused by the necessity to pull container images from remote registries. Pre-pulling images can improve start times significantly. The _Kubernetes Image Puller_ can be used to pre-pull images and shorten workspace start times.

The Kubernetes Image Puller is an additional deployment that runs alongside {prod}. Given a list of images to pre-pull, the application runs inside a cluster and creates a _daemonset_ that pulls the images on each node.

The application can be link:{site-baseurl}che-7/deploy-kubernetes-image-puller-on-k8s-with-helm[deployed via Helm] or by link:{site-baseurl}che-7/deploying-kubernetes-image-puller-on-openshift[processing and applying OpenShift templates].

The Kubernetes Image Puller pulls its configuration from a `ConfigMap` with the following available parameters:
