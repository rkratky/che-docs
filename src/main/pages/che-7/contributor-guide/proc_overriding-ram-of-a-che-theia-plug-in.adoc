= Overriding RAM of a Che-Theia plug-in

Sometimes, a plug-in consumes more memory than what has been allocated to it by the plug-in author or Che defaults. An example of such a case is the use of a language server with a project that has many source files (&8gt;{nbsp}10{nbsp}000). RAM consumption in such circumstanes needs to be tuned, otherwise the machine that runs the Che workspaces kills the process with an out-of-memory error (OOM) error.


.Procedure

Users can override the RAM limit for a particular plug-in in their workspace configuration.

* Set the workspace attribute `sidecar.<plugin ID>.memory_limit` to `1000M` or `10Gi`, or any other value formatted as a number and a unit (`b, k, ki, m, mi, g, gi`). When no unit is specified, the number is in bytes.

NOTE: Using this notation, units that contain the character `i`, denote a number that is of the power 2, such as 1024 (as opposed to numbers that use a power of 10, such as 1000).
