= Developing a Che-Theia plug-in using Che

This section describes how to set up an environment for developing the Che-Theia plug-ins in Eclipse Che.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of Eclipse Che. To install an instance of Eclipse Che, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[Che 'quick-starts'].

* `chectl` management tool is installed. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/installing-the-chectl-management-tool/[Installing the `chectl` management tool]

. *Create a workspace for development.* Che has dedicated stacks for plug-in development. In the *Dashboard*, click the *Workspaces* tab, and click the btn:[Add Workspace] button.
+
.Adding a workspace

. Select the *Che 7 Dev* stack, and click the btn:[CREATE & OPEN] button.
+
.Choosing the 'Che 7 Dev' stack

. *Generate a plug-in scaffold.* The workspace created from this stack provides an easy way to scaffold a new plug-in. When the workspace is started and fully ready, execute the *Yeoman Wizard* from the command palette:
+
.. Press *F1* or kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+p] to invoke the command palette, and start typing the command name `Yeoman ...` (note that you can also use the keyboard to navigate through the offered commands).
+
.Launching the Yeoman Wizard

+
.. Fill in the following fields about the plug-in that you want to create: 
+
* plug-in name: For example, `my-first-plugin`.
* plug-in type: Select `backend plug-in`.
* plug-in template: Select the `Hello World plug-in`.
+
A message confirming that the plug-in generation has been successful indicates creation of the plug-in.
+
.Yeoman successfully generated a new plug-in

. Open the *Files* panel, to see the sources of the generated plug-in in the `src` directory.

. *Build the plug-in.* After the plug-in is created, build the plug-in:
+
.. Open a new terminal in the development container (use kbd:[Ctrl+`], then select ``ws/dev``).
+
.Opening a new terminal in the development container

+
.. In the terminal, go to the plug-in directory, and run the `yarn` command:
+
----
# cd my-first-plugin/
# yarn
----
+
.Building a Che-Theia plug-in using `yarn`

+
NOTE: The plug-in generator automatically builds the plug-in after its generation.

. *Run the plug-in.* To see your plug-in in action in the IDE, use the *Hosted mode* to start a new IDE instance and to install the plug-in in it. You now have two IDEs running: one for developing your plug-in and one for testing it.
+
.. In the command palette, run: `Hosted Plugin: Start Instance` command (press kbd:[F1], and type the command).
.. Select the path to the root directory of the plug-in in your workspace.
+
NOTE: If you get a warning that your browser prevented the opening of a new tab, click the btn:[Open] button in the dialog box. A new tab with another Theia instance (with the developed plug-in loaded) is opened.
+
.Running a Che-Theia plug-in in Hosted mode

. *Debug the plug-in.*
+
.. In the source code of your plug-in, set a breakpoint by clicking behind a line number (in the editor gutter).
.. Using the command palette, stop your *Hosted Plug-in* instance (if any) by running the `Hosted Plugin: Stop Instance` command.
.. Start the *Hosted Plug-in* instance again in the debugging mode by running the `Hosted Plugin: Debug Instance` command.
.. Switch to the *Hosted Instance* tab and perform the required actions to reach the code with the breakpoint.
.. Go back to the *Main Theia* window, and use the *Debug* panel as you need.

NOTE: When developing a frontend plug-in, debug it using your browserâ€™s Developer Tools option.
