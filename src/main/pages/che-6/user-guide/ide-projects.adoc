== Default location of projects

When a workspace machine with a workspace agent starts, the IDE makes calls to the Project API to fetch the workspace projects. By default, projects are located in the `/projects` directory in a machine container or pod. You can not configure this location because other IDE components depend on it.

Projects are displayed in the project tree in the left panel. To view the projects on the terminal, use the `ls -la /projects` command. When a workspace is stopped, its machines are terminated. The `/projects` directory is mounted on the host file system (either data volume or PVC). When a new container or pod is started, your workspace projects are always there.

[id="file-watchers"]
== File watchers

Changes to project source files do not originate from the IDE editor only. File watchers listen to changes on the file system. Resources that you create, edit, or delete on your file system using the terminal or REST API propagate to the project tree and the editor. When importing projects, file watchers are disabled to avoid flooding events.

== Importing projects in the IDE 

The following are two ways to import a project in the IDE:

* Add a project to the link:projects.html[workspace configuration] in the *Dashboard*. After the workspace configuration is saved, and the workspace is being opened, the IDE obtains the workspace configuration. Projects associated with the workspace configuration are automatically imported. If these projects are present in a file system, the IDE skips this step.

* Import a project into a running workspace using the *Workspace* > *Import project* menu option. To import a private project, link:version-control.html[set up the SSH keys].
