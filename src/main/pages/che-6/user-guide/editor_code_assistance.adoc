[id="orion-editor"]
== Orion editor

=== Use with Che
Eclipse Che uses the Orion editor and integrate it with the language servers, Git, debugger, and other services that run on the server and client side. Che allows the use of custom or user-provided editors. See link:editor.html[Editor] for more information.

[id="syntax-highlighting"]
=== Syntax highlighting with Orion

By default, the Orion editor provides syntax highlighting. Che overrides styles for some file types and uses existing styles for other file types. When the opened file does not have syntax highlighting, this means that Orion does not recognize this file type. You can define your own syntax highlighting for custom file types or override existing styles. See: link:editor.html[Editor] for more information.

[id="code-assistant"]
=== Code assistant

The Orion editor provides code assistance for JavaScript.

Code assistance for other languages is provided by link:language-servers.html[Language Servers]. Eclipse Che supports code assistance for Java, C#, PHP, Python, TypeScript, YAML and JSON. There are plans to add language servers for Golang.
