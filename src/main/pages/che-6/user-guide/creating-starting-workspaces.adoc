== Creating workspaces

Use the link:stacks.html[stacks] in the *Dashboard* to create a workspace. Images and configuration in these stacks are certified both for Docker and OpenShift. These stacks are used in daily functional testing.

=== Creating a workspace from stacks in the dashboard

To create a workspace from stacks in the *Dashboard*, take the following steps:

. In the *Dashboard*, in the left panel, click *Stacks*.

. Click the *Duplicate stack* icon for the stack that you want to create a clone of. A page titled after the selected stack opens.

. Edit the fields that you want to edit.

. Click *Save*.

=== Duplicating an existing stack

Create a stack and then use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

To create a copy of an existing stack, take the following steps:

. In the *Dashboard*, in the left panel, click *Stacks*.

. Click the *Duplicate stack* icon for the stack that you want to clone.

. Edit the *Name* field.

. In the *Machines* field, edit the *Source* field.

. Click *Save*. The *Stack is successfully updated* message confirms that the stack is updated.

. In the *Dashboard*, click *Workspaces* > *Add Workspace*.

. In the *SELECT STACK* section, scroll through the list to locate the stack that you created in the preceding steps. 

. Click *Create* to create the workspace based on this stack.

=== Creating a custom stack from a custom recipe

Author a custom link:recipes.html[recipe] and then create a stack. Use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

To create a custom stack from a custom recipe, take the following steps:

. In the *Dashboard*, click *Workspaces* > *Add Workspace*.

. From the *SELECT STACK* field, select the required stack.

. Click *Add Stack*.

. In the *Create Stack* dialog box, click *Yes* to confirm that you want to create the stack from a recipe. 

. In the *Build stack from recipe* window, type the recipe name from which you want to build this stack (example: `FROM: eclipse/new-stack`).

. Click *OK*.

. In the *Name* field, type a name for the stack.

. In the *Runtimes* > *Machines* > *Recipe* section, click *Show* to ensure that the stack is being created using the recipe that you set in the preceding steps (*eclipse/new-stack*, in this case).

. Click *Save*.

[id="starting-workspaces"]
== Starting workspaces

You can start a workspace in one of the following ways:

* The workspace starts automatically after it is created in the user's *Dashboard*.

* In the user's *Dashboard*, use the *Run* or *Open* buttons in the *Workspace Details* view.

* Click a workspace name from the *Recent Workspaces* displayed in the left panel.

* Use the REST API. For more information about the REST API, see link:rest-api.html[REST API].

The workspace may take time to start depending on factors like network conditions, container image availability, and configured installers attempting to install additional tools and software in the runtime. Track the progress of the workspace start operation in the *Workspace Start* tab. The tabs for each machine in the workspace environment stream logs from the installers (terminal, `exec` agent, `ws` agent, and language servers if any).

[id="managing-a-workspace"]
== Managing a workspace

After a workspace is created or started, you can modify it by adding projects, installers, environment variables, and volumes. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
To edit a raw workspace configuration, back up the working configuration to avoid breaking your workspace. 
====

Change the configuration of a running workspace and saving it restarts the workspace. To learn more about workspace configuration, see:

* link:projects.html[Creating projects in workspaces]

* link:installers.html[Installers]

* link:env-variables.html[Environment variables]

* link:volumes.html[Volumes]
