[id="maven"]
== Maven

Maven is natively supported by JDT.LS.

You can forcefully update dependencies for a Maven project by selecting *Maven > Reimport* from the context menu.

[id="gradle"]
== Gradle

Gradle is natively supported by JDT.LS.

[id="npm"]
== NPM

There is no plugin for Che that would automatically run `npm install` for JavaScript projects. As a workaround, you can create a link:commands-ide-macro.html[custom command] to install dependencies.
