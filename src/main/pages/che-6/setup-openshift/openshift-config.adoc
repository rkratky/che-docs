[id="admin-guide"]
== Admin Guide

See: link:openshift-admin-guide.html[OpenShift Admin Guide] to general information that works both for OS and K8S.

[id="configure-che-server"]
== Configure Che Server

Che server is configured by updating environment variables passed to Che deployment. You can configure Che Server when initially deploying Che (See: link:openshift-single-user.html[Installation Single User], link:openshift-multi-user.html[Multi-User]) or afterwards, by modifying Che deployment.

There are multiple ways to modify Che deployment to add new or modify existing environment variables. You can either:

* *Option 1: Update Che deployment yaml.* To update Che deployment yaml and update in nano editor (VIM is used by default), run this command: `$ OC_EDITOR="nano" oc edit dc/che`
* *Option 2: Update manually in OpenShift web console.* To update manually in OpenShift web console > deployments > Che > Environment
* *Option 3: Modify environment variables.* To update Che deployment with new environment variables or modify existing variables, run this command: `$ oc set env dc/che KEY=VALUE KEY1=VALUE1`

[id="what-can-be-configured"]
== What Can Be Configured?

You can find deployment env or config map in yaml files.

Here is a https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/che[complete] list of all properties that are configurable for Che server.

You can manually convert properties into envs, just make sure to follow link:properties.html#properties-and-environment-variables[instructions on properties page]

[id="https-mode"]
== HTTPS Mode

To enable https for server and workspace routes, follow instructions in link:openshift-single-user.html[setup docs single user] and link:openshift-multi-user.html[multi-user].

To migrate an existing Che deployment to https, do the following:

1.  Update Che deployment with `PROTOCOL=https, WS_PROTOCOL=wss, TLS=true`
2.  Manually edit or recreate routes for Che and Keycloak `oc apply -f https`
3.  Once done, go to `https://keycloak-${NAMESPACE}.${ROUTING_SUFFIX}`, log in to admin console. Default credentials are `admin:admin`. Go to Clients, `che-public` client and edit *Valid Redirect URIs* and *Web Origins* URLs so that they use *https* protocol. You do not need to do that if you initially deploy Che with https support.

[id="https-mode---self-signed-certs"]
== HTTPS Mode - Self-Signed Certs

If you enable HTTPS mode for multi-user Che on an OpenShift installation that does not have certificates signed by a public authority, it won’t be possible to start workspaces or even login.

There is a lot of communication between Che server and workspace agents, Che server and Keycloak. Therefore, self signed certs should be added to Java trust store of Che server and Keycloak (only for a multi user Che deployment) pods, as well as workspace images. While there is automation for Che server and Keycloak, certs should be manually added to workspace images, since adding a root certificate requires sudo privileges which an arbitrary OpenShift user may not have.

* Export certificate:

This has to be the certificate that your OpenShift *router* uses since OpenShift Web Console may use a different cert or even use a different (sub)domain. If you are not certain where to find the cert, you may export it:

image::workspaces/chrome_cert.png[]

Choose the top certificate hierarchy and export a single certificate.

* Create a secret with certificate:

----
CERTIFICATE=$(cat /path/to/openshift/ca.crt)
oc new-app -f deploy/openshift/templates/multi/openshift-certificate-secret.yaml -p CERTIFICATE="${CERTIFICATE}"
----

There is another way to create a secret with a certificate using the `oc` (or `kubectl`) client:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
    oc create secret generic self-signed-certificate --from-file=__</path/to/certificate__
----

Once `self-signed-certificate` is created, the `pass:[CHE_SELF__SIGNED__CERT]` environment variable takes the content of the certificate file as a value and is then used in entrypoints of the Che server and Keycloak images.
The secret is also propagated to workspace pods and agents like *exec*. The *terminal* and *workspace* agents use it when connecting to a workspace master.

[id="https-mode---letsencrypt"]
== HTTPS Mode - Letsencrypt

Letsencrypt can issue wildcard certificates. There’s only one pre-requisite - your OpenShift installation should be under a *public DNS name*. The best way to solve TLS issue with Eclipse Che is to get Letsencrypt certs for `*.${OPENSHIFT_ROUTING_SUFFIX}` domain and then configure OpenShift router to use those certs. Once done, it will automatically make all secure routes that your OpenShift cluster generates trusted by all clients.

To obtain a wildcard Letsencrypt certificate for your OpenShift router visit https://certbot.eff.org/[Certbot] page and follow instructions for your OS. Once done and key are generated, there are a few things you should do (requires OpenShift admin privileges) in default OpenShift namespace where router is deployed:

----
# add the key to the cert
cat fullchain.pem privkey.pem > both.pem

#  Backup the old config
oc export secret router-certs > ~/old-router-certs-secret.yaml

# Replace the router certificate
oc secrets new router-certs tls.crt=both.pem tls.key=privkey.pem -o json --type='kubernetes.io/tls' --confirm | oc replace -f -

# Rollout the latest DC for the router
oc rollout latest router
----

You may also find the following docs/blog posts helpful:

* https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/redeploying_certificates.html#redeploying-custom-registry-or-router-certificates[OpenShift Docs]
* https://blog.openshift.com/lets-encrypt-acme-v2-api/[OpenShift Blog]

After a router restarts, all secure routes in the cluster should be trusted, and you can deploy Che in https mode: link:openshift-single-user.html#https-mode[single user] or link:openshift-multi-user.html#openshift-container-platform[multi-user] or update your http Che installation.

[id="private-docker-registries"]
== Private Docker Registries

Refer to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/security/registries.html[OpenShift documentation]

[id="enable-ssh-and-sudo"]
== Enable ssh and sudo

By default, pods are run with an arbitrary user that has a randomly generated UID (the range is defined in OpenShift config file). This security constrain has several consequences for Eclipse Che users:

* installers for language servers will fail since most of them require `sudo`
* no way to run any sudo commands in a running workspace

It is possible to allow root access which in its turn allows running system services and change file/directory link:#filesystem-permissions[permissions]. You can change this behavior. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#enable-images-to-run-with-user-in-the-dockerfile[OpenShift Documentation for details].

You may also configure some services to bind to ports below `1024`, say, apache2. Here’s an example of enabling it for https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles/blob/master/recipes/php/Dockerfile#L49[Apache2] in a PHP image.

*How to Get a Shell in a Pod?*

Since OpenShift routes do not support ssh protocol, once cannot run sshd (or equivalent) in a pod and ssh into it. However, OpenShift itself provides a few alternatives (only for users who can authenticate as a user that has deployed Che):

* `oc rsh ${POD_NAME}` (you can get running pods with `oc`). Note that this is a remote shell, not an ssh connection
* in an OpenShift *web console, projects > ws-namespace > pods > pod details > Terminal*.

Once Che server is able to create OpenShift objects on behalf of a current user, rsh will be available for all users. You may follow GitHub https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/8178[issue] to get updates.

[id="filesystem-permissions"]
== Filesystem Permissions

As said above, pods in OpenShift are started with an arbitrary user with a dynamic UID that is generated for each namespace individually. As a result, a user in an OpenShift pod does not have write permissions for files and directories unless root group (UID - `0`) has write permissions for those (an arbitrary user in OpenShift belongs to root group). All Che ready to go stacks are optimized to run well on OpenShift. See an example from a https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles/blob/master/recipes/stack-base/centos/Dockerfile#L45-L48[base image]. What happens there is that a root group has write permissions for `/projects` (where workspace projects are located), a user home directory and some other dirs.

[id="multi-user-using-own-keycloak-and-psql"]
== Multi-User: Using Own Keycloak and PSQL

Out of the box Che is deployed together with Keycloak and Postgres pods, and all three services are properly configured to be able to communicate. However, it does not matter for Che what Keycloak server and Postgres DB to use, as long as those have compatible versions and meet certain requirements.

Follow instructions on deploying multi-user link:openshift-multi-user.html[Che without Keycloak or Postgres or both].

*_Che Server and Keycloak_*

Keycloak server URL is retrieved from the `pass:[CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__SERVER__URL]` environment variable. A new installation of Che will use its own Keycloak server running in a Docker container pre-configured to communicate with Che server. Realm and client are mandatory environment variables. By default Keycloak environment variables are:

----
CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__SERVER__URL=http://${KC_ROUTE}:5050/auth
CHE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=che
CHE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT__ID=che-public
----

You can use your own Keycloak server. Create a new realm and a public client. A few things to keep in mind:

* It must be a public client
* `redirectUris` should be `${CHE_SERVER_ROUTE}/*`. If no or incorrect `redirectUris` are provided or the one used is not in the list of `redirectUris`, Keycloak will display an error saying that redirect_uri param is invalid.
* `webOrigins` should be either`${CHE_SERVER_ROUTE}` or `*`. If no or incorrect `webOrigins` are provided, Keycloak script won’t be injected into a page because of CORS error.

*_Using an alternate OIDC provider instead of Keycloak_*

Instead using a Keycloak server, Che now provides a limited support for alternate authentication servers compatible with the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenId Connect specification].

Some limitations restrict the alternate OIDC providers that can be used with Eclipse Che. Supported providers should:

* implement access tokens as JWT tokens including at least the following claims:
** `exp`: the expiration time (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)
** `sub`: the subject (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)
* allow redirect Urls with wildcards at the end
* provide an endpoint that returns the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig[OpenID Provider Configuration information]. According to the specification, this endpoint should end with sub-path `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

When using an alternate OIDC provider, the following Keycloak environment variables should be set to `NULL`:

----
CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__SERVER__URL=NULL
CHE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=NULL
----

Instead, you should set the folowing environement variables:

----
CHE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT__ID=<client id provided by the OIDC provider>
CHE_KEYCLOAK_OIDC__PROVIDER=<base URL of the OIDC provider that provides a configuration endpoint at `/.well-known/openid-configuration` sub-path>
----

If the optional http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest[`nonce` OpenId request parameter] is not supported, the following environment variable should be added:

----
CHE_KEYCLOAK_USE__NONCE=FALSE
----

By default, the OIDC authentication in Che requires using redirect URLs with wildcards. For alternate OIDC providers that only support a list of fixed redirect URLs, use the following environment variable to switch to fixed redirect URL mode:

----
CHE_KEYCLOAK_USE__FIXED__REDIRECT__URLS=TRUE
----

In this case, the two redirect URLs that should be registered in the OIDC provider configuration are:
----
${CHE_SERVER_ROUTE}/api/keycloak/oidcCallbackIde.html
${CHE_SERVER_ROUTE}/api/keycloak/oidcCallbackDashboard.html
----


*_Che Server and PostgreSQL_*

Che server uses the below defaults to connect to PostgreSQL to store info related to users, user preferences and workspaces:

----
CHE_JDBC_USERNAME=pgche
CHE_JDBC_PASSWORD=pgchepassword
CHE_JDBC_DATABASE=dbche
CHE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/dbche
CHE_JDBC_DRIVER__CLASS__NAME=org.postgresql.Driver
CHE_JDBC_MAX__TOTAL=20
CHE_JDBC_MAX__IDLE=10
CHE_JDBC_MAX__WAIT__MILLIS=-1
----

Che currently uses version 9.6.

*_Keycloak and PostgreSQL_*

Database URL, port, database name, user and password are defined as environment variables in Keycloak pod. Defaults are:

----
POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DATABASE=keycloak
POSTGRES_USER=keycloak
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=keycloak
----

[id="development-mode"]
== Development Mode

After you have built your link:assemblies.html[custom assembly], execute `build.sh` https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/dockerfiles/che[script]. You can then tag it, either push to MiniShift or a public Docker registry, and reference in your Che deployment as `CHE_IMAGE_REPO` and `CHE_IMAGE_TAG`. Alternatively, you may make sure the image is available locally and change pull policy to `IfNotPresent` in che deployment.

[id="che-workspace-termination-grace-period"]
== Che Workspace Termination Grace Period

Info about changing workspace termination grace period can be found in the following link:kubernetes-config.html#che-workspace-termination-grace-period[section] of the Che Kubernetes config document.
