The Che on Docker configuration is handled by modifying the https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/manifests/che.env[`che.env`] file that is placed in the root directory of a host directory mounted to `:/data`. This configuration file is generated during the `che init` phase. If you rerun the `che init` command in an already initialized directory, the process will abort unless you pass the `--force`, `--pull`, or `--reinit` options.

You can also pass an environment variable directly in the `docker run` syntax: `-e CHE_ENV_NAME=value`.

Each variable is documented with an explanation and usually commented out. If you need to set a variable, uncomment it and configure it with your value. You can then run the `che config` command to apply this configuration to your system. The `che start` command also reapplies the latest configuration.

You can run the `che init` command to install a new configuration into an empty directory. This command uses the `che/init:<version>` Docker container to deliver a version-specific set of Puppet templates into the directory.

If you run the `che config` command, Che runs Puppet to transform your Puppet templates into a Che instance configuration. It places the results either into the `/che/instance` directory if you mounted that, or into an `instance` subdirectory of the path you mounted to `/che`. Each time you start Che, the `che config` command is run to ensure that the instance configuration files are properly generated and consistent with the configuration you have specified in the `che.env` file.

Administration teams that want to manage versions of your Che configuration should save the `che.env` file. This is the only file that should be saved with version control. It is not necessary to save any other files. To upgrade, use the `che upgrade` command and replace these files with templates that are specific to the version that is being upgraded. The `che.env` file remains the same between versions and you can generate instance configurations from that.

The following is the version-control sequence:

. Run the `che init` command to get an initial configuration for a particular version.
. Edit the `che.env` file with your environment-specific configuration.
. Save the `che.env` file to version control.
. Setup a new directory and copy the `che.env` file from version control into the directory you will mount to `:/data`.
. Run the `che config` or the `che start` command.

[id="running-che-in-single-port-mode"]
== Running Che in single-port mode

By default, Che lets Docker publish exposed ports in a random manner. Docker chooses available ports from the ephemeral port range to expose workspace link:servers.html[servers]. This requires the opening of the ephemeral port range (and the Keycloak `5050` port for multi-user Che) to the world.

To run Che in single-port mode, add `-e CHE_SINGLE_PORT=true` to the run syntax. In this case, a Traefik container will be used to route traffic through a single port.

=== Using wildcard DNS

In single-port mode, Che builds URLs of workspace services using the following pattern: `serviceName-machineName-ws-ID.IP.wildcardDNSProvider`. For example, with an external IP of `193.12.34.56`, the URL of a workspace agent will be `wsagent-http-dev-machine-workspace0bcgkgkvsqi31b4u.193.12.34.56.nip.io`.

* By default, http://nip.io/[nip.io] is used. This is an external wildcard DNS provider. The nip.io service must be available for networking in single-port Che to work correctly.

* You can use a different wildcard DNS provider with the `CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD__DOMAIN_HOST` environment variable.

* To exclude the external IP from the URL (`serviceName-machineName-ws-ID.wildcardDNSProvider`, for example to use a wildcard SSL certificate), specify `CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD_DOMAIN_IPLESS=true` with a custom wildcard DNS (example: `CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD_DOMAIN_HOST=domain.tld`). You must have a matching DNS entry for `*.domain.tld`. In multi-user mode, Keycloak will be provided at `keycloak.domain.tld`.

[id="configuring-keycloak-in-multi-user-mode"]
=== Configuring Keycloak in multi-user mode

Ensure that `webOrigins` and `redirectUris` in Keycloak client settings (`che-public` client) reference your `CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL` value, that is the IP that external users will use to log in. Keycloak administration console in multi-user Che is available at `http://keycloak.$IP.$wildcardDNSProvider:$chePort/auth/`. Here, `$IP` is either your `docker0` IP or the `CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL` value.

[id="accessing-logs-and-user-data"]
== Accessing logs and user data

When Che initializes itself, it stores logs, user data, database data, and instance-specific configuration in the directory mounted to `:/data/instance` or an `instance` subdirectory of what you mounted to `:/data`.

Che containers save their logs in the same location:

----
/instance/logs/che/2016                 <1>
/instance/logs/che/che-machine-logs     <2>
----
<1> Server logs
<2> Workspace logs

There may be cases of logs encoding settings when Che master logs are not stored in the location above.

User data is stored in:

----
/instance/data/che                      <1>
----
<1> Project backups (synchronized projects from remote workspaces)

Instance configuration is generated by Che and is updated by the internal configuration utilities. Do not modify these generated configuration files. Store them at:

----
/instance/che.ver.do_not_modify         <1>
/instance/docker-compose-container.yml  <2>
/instance/docker-compose.yml            <3>
/instance/config                        <4>
----
<1> Version of che installed
<2> Docker compose to launch Che from within a container
<3> Docker compose to launch Che from the host without container
<4> Configuration files for Che, which are volume mounted into containers

[id="jdbc-configuration"]
== Configuring JDBC

Eclipse Che uses the http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] database for single-user builds and PostgreSQL database in multi-user mode.

Depending on the used database, the JDBC Connection pool is initialized with respective default values. These values can be overridden in the `che.env` file.

Example of configuration for using the H2 database (default for single-user Che):

----
CHE_JDBC_USERNAME=
CHE_JDBC_PASSWORD=
CHE_JDBC_DATABASE=jdbc:h2:che
CHE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/dbche
CHE_JDBC_DRIVER__CLASS__NAME=org.h2.Driver
CHE_JDBC_MAX__TOTAL=8
CHE_JDBC_MAX__IDLE=2
CHE_JDBC_MAX__WAIT__MILLIS=-1
----

Example of configuration for using the PostgreSQL database (default for multi-user Che):

----
CHE_JDBC_USERNAME=pgche
CHE_JDBC_PASSWORD=pgchepassword
CHE_JDBC_DATABASE=dbche
CHE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/dbche
CHE_JDBC_DRIVER__CLASS__NAME=org.postgresql.Driver
CHE_JDBC_MAX__TOTAL=20
CHE_JDBC_MAX__IDLE=10
CHE_JDBC_MAX__WAIT__MILLIS=-1
----

[id="oauth"]
== Configuring OAuth

You can configure using Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or BitBucket OAuth for Git operations. See: link:version-control.html#github-oauth[Version Control].

[id="stacks-and-samples"]
== Creating stacks and samples

link:stacks.html[Stacks] define the recipes used to create workspace runtimes. They appear in the stack library of the dashboard. You can create your own stacks.

The `CHE_PREDEFINED_STACKS_RELOAD__ON__START` variable (set to `false` by default) defines the stack loading policy. When set to `false`, stacks are loaded from a JSON file only once during database initialization. When set to `true`, the JSON file is sourced every time the Che server starts.

Code samples allow you to define sample projects that are cloned into a workspace if the user chooses it when creating a new project. You can add your own code samples. In your `${LOCAL_DATA_DIR}/instance/data/templates` directory, create a JSON file with your custom samples. It will be sourced each time the Che server starts. For an example of a default Che `samples.json` file, see https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/ide/che-core-ide-templates/src/main/resources/samples.json[samples.json].

[id="workspace-limits"]
== Placing workspace limits

You can place limits on how users interact with the system to control the overall system resource usage. You can define the number of workspaces created, RAM consumed, idle timeout, and a variety of other parameters.

You can also set limits on Dockerâ€™s allocation of CPU to workspaces, which may be necessary if you have a very dense workspace population where users are competing for limited physical resources.

Workspace idle timeout can be configured in the `che.env` file so that the inactive workspaces are stopped automatically over this length of time in milliseconds. By default, this value is set to `3600000` (1 hour). If set to `0`, workspaces will not stop automatically. Currently, keyboard and mouse interactions in the IDE and HTTP requests to the `ws-agent` count as activity.

[id="setting-the-java-opts-environment-variable"]
== Setting the JAVA_OPTS environment variable

There can be several Java processes running in a workspace machine. Some Java agents are special purpose agents started in a machine to provide core and additional IDE functionalities. These are workspace agents and a link:dependency-management.html[Maven plugin] that are both started in the JVM. You can run your own Java programs and use build tools like Maven. A set of the following environment variables can help optimize RAM consumption:

=== User-defined environment variables

You can provide your own link:env-variables.html[environment variables] per workspace machine.

`pass:[JAVA_OPTS]`::
machine-wide java opts

`pass:[MAVEN_OPTS]`::
machine-wide maven opts

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_WSAGENT__JAVA__OPTIONS]`::
java opts to adjust java opts of ws-agent

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_MAVEN__SERVER__JAVA__OPTIONS]`::
java opts to adjust java opts of the maven server

Che administrators (anyone with access to the `che.env` file or the Che server environment directly) can override the following user-defined environment variables:

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_JAVA__OPTIONS]`::
Overrides the default value of JAVA_OPTS of all workspaces

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_MAVEN__OPTIONS]`::
Overrides the default value of MAVEN_OPTS of all workspaces

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_WSAGENT__JAVA__OPTIONS]`::
Overrides the default value of JAVA_OPTS of all ws-agents

`pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_MAVEN__SERVER__JAVA__OPTIONS]`::
Overrides the default value of JAVA_OPTS of all maven servers

For default values of the environment variables, see the https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/manifests/che.env#L127-L141[che.env] file.

[id="hostname"]
== Hostname

Hostname is the IP address or DNS name where the Che endpoint provides service to the users. 

* When run on a local system, the value of the hostname is auto-detected as the IP address of your Docker daemon. 

* On many systems, especially those from cloud hosting providers like DigitalOcean, you may have to explicitly set this to the external IP address or DNS entry provided by the provider. 

You can edit this value in the `che.env` file and restart Che, or you can pass it during initialization.

----
$ docker run <OTHER-DOCKER_OPTIONS> -e CHE_HOST=<ip-addr-or-dns> eclipse/che:<version> start
----

[id="networking"]
== Networking

Eclipse Che makes connections between three entities: the browser, the Che server running in a Docker container, and a workspace running in a Docker container.

To distribute these components on different nodes, hosts, or IP addresses, add additional configuration parameters to bridge the different networks.

The Che server and your Che workspaces are within containers governed by the Docker daemon. You must ensure that these components have bridges to communicate with the daemon.

Your browser, the Che server, and the Che workspace being on the same node ensures that the `localhost` configuration works correctly.

=== WebSockets

Che relies on WebSockets to stream content between workspaces and the browser. There are many networks and firewalls that block portions of the WebSocket communication. If there are any initial configuration issues, this is a likely cause of the problem.

=== Topology

The Che server runs in its own Docker-formatted container, `Che Docker Container`. Each workspace has an embedded runtime that can be a set of additional Docker containers, `Docker Container(n)`. All containers are managed by a common Docker daemon, `docker-ip`, making them siblings of each other. This includes the Che server and its workspaces. Each workspace runtime environment has a set of containers that is a sibling to the Che server and is not a child.

=== Connectivity

The browser client initiates communication with the Che server by connecting to `che-ip`. This IP address must be accessible by your browser clients. Internally, Che runs on Tomcat that is bound to port `8080`. This port can be altered by setting the `CHE_PORT` variable during start or in the `che.env` file.

When a user creates a workspace, the Che server connects to the Docker daemon at `docker-ip` and uses the daemon to launch a new set of containers that power the workspace. These workspace containers have a Docker-configured IP address, `workspace-container-ip`. The `workspace-container-ip` is not usually reachable by your browser host. `docker-ip` is used to establish the connections between the browser and workspace containers.

The Che server provides workspace containers with the following environment variables:

`CHE_API_INTERNAL`::
* Points to the internal API endpoint that is accessible across other machines within the workspace. 
* Its value is taken from the Che server `CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_MASTER__API__ENDPOINT` variable that can be initialized either by the CLI or the default value defined in the `che.properties` file.

`CHE_API_EXTERNAL`::
* Points to the external API endpoint that is used by the browser clients. 
* Its value is taken from the Che server `CHE_API` variable. 
* Its default value is defined in the `che.properties` file.

`CHE_API`::
* Points to the same value as `CHE_API_INTERNAL` for backward compatibility.

[NOTE]
====
The `CHE_API` environment variable will be deprecated in a future release.
====

When Che is booting or starting a workspace, Che goes through a progression algorithm to establish the protocol, IP address, and port to establish communication. You can override certain parameters in Cheâ€™s configuration to overcome issues with the Docker daemon, workspaces, or browsers being on different networks.

=== Browser -> Che server

The `${CHE_HOST}:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api` variable is the default. However, requests are sent to the IP or hostname in your browser address bar. You can also use the value of `che.api`.

=== Che server -> Docker daemon progression

Use the value of the `che.infra.docker.daemon_url` variable. You can also use one of the following values:

* The value of the `DOCKER_HOST` system variable

* The Unix socket over `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`

* The default `docker0` IP address - `172.17.42.1`

=== Che Server -> Workspace Connection

Use the value of the `che.docker.ip` variable. Or, use the address of the docker0 bridge network, if available.

=== Browser -> Workspace Connection

Use the value of the `che.docker.ip.external` variable. Or, use the `che.docker.ip` value, or the value provided by the `ws container inspect` command.

=== Workspace Agent -> Che Server

If set, use the value of the `pass:[CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_MASTER__API__ENDPOINT]` variable. The default value is `http://che-host:${SERVER_PORT}/api`; here, `che-host` is the IP of docker0 (Linux) or the VM IP (macOS and Windows).

When Che is configured with firewalls, routers, networks, and hosts, the default values detected, as a known behavior, establish faulty connections. To run a test that makes connections between simulated components reflect the networking setup of Che as it is configured, execute the `docker run <DOCKER_OPTIONS> eclipse/che info --network` command. It is acceptable that all connections may not pass for Che to be properly configured. For example, on a Windows machine, this output may exist indicating that `localhost` is not an acceptable domain for communication but the IP address `10.0.75.2` is.

----
INFO: ---------------------------------------
INFO: --------   CONNECTIVITY TEST   --------
INFO: ---------------------------------------
INFO: Browser    => Workspace Agent (localhost): Connection failed
INFO: Browser    => Workspace Agent (10.0.75.2): Connection succeeded
INFO: Server     => Workspace Agent (External IP): Connection failed
INFO: Server     => Workspace Agent (Internal IP): Connection succeeded
----

You can also perform additional tests against an already-running Che server. Use the `docker ps` and `docker inspect` commands to get the container name and IP address of your Che server. Then, you can run additional tests:

* Browser => Workspace Agent (External IP):
+
----
$ curl http://<che-ip>:<che-port>/wsagent/ext/
----
+
* Server => Workspace Agent (External IP):
+
----
docker exec -ti <che-container-name> curl http://<che-ip>:<che-port>/wsagent/ext/
----
+
* Server => Workspace Agent (Internal IP):
+
----
docker exec -ti <che-container-name> curl http://<workspace-container-ip>:4401/wsagent/ext/
----

=== DNS resolution

Che and its workspaces, by default, inherit DNS resolver servers from the host. You can override these resolvers by setting the `CHE_DNS_RESOLVERS` variable in the `che.env` file and restarting Che. DNS resolvers allow programs and services that are deployed within a user workspace to perform DNS lookups with public or internal resolver servers. In some environments, custom resolution of DNS entries (usually to an internal DNS provider) is required to enable the Che server and the workspace runtimes to have lookup ability for internal services.

To update your `che.env` file with a comma-separated list of resolvers:

----
CHE_DNS_RESOLVERS=10.10.10.10,8.8.8.8
----

[id="single-port-routing"]
== Single-port routing

Single-port routing is currently not supported in Che 6.

[id="private-images"]
== Private images

When users create a workspace in Eclipse Che, they must select a container image to power the workspace. Che provides stacks that reference images hosted at the public DockerHub that do not require any authenticated access to pull. You can provide your own images that are stored in a local private registry or at Docker Hub. The images may be publicly or privately visible, even if they are a part of a private registry.

If the stack images that Che wants to pull require authenticated access to any registry then you must configure registry authentication.

In the `che.env` file:

----
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AUTH_REGISTRY1_URL=url1
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AUTH_REGISTRY1_USERNAME=username1
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AUTH_REGISTRY1_PASSWORD=password1

CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AWS_REGISTRY1_ID=id1
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AWS_REGISTRY1_REGION=region1
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AWS_REGISTRY1_ACCESS__KEY__ID=key_id1
CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY_AWS_REGISTRY1_SECRET__ACCESS__KEY=secret1
----

There are different configurations for AWS EC2 and the Docker registry. Using the numerical indicator in the environment variable, you can define as many different registries as you want. To add several registries, copy the set of properties and append `REGISTRY[n]` for each variable.

=== Pulling private images in stacks

After you have configured private registry access, any Che stack that has `FROM <registry>/<repository>` that requires authenticated access will use the credentials provided in the `che.env` file to access the registry.

----
# Syntax
FROM <repository>/<image>:<tag>

# Example:
FROM my.registry.url:9000/image:latest
----

To read more about registries, see https://docs.docker.com/registry/[Docker documentation].

[id="privileged-mode"]
== Enabling privileged mode

Docker privileged mode allows a container to have root-level access to the host from within the container. This enables containers to do more than they normally can but also presents security risks. You can enable your workspaces to have privileged mode, giving your users root-level access to the host where Che is running (in addition to root access of their workspaces). Privileged mode is necessary if you want to enable certain features such as Docker in Docker.

By default, Che workspaces powered by a Docker container are not configured with Docker privileged mode. There are many security risks associated with activating this feature. Review the various issues mentioned in the blogs posted online.

To update the `che.env` file:

----
CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=true
----

[id="mirroring-dockerhub"]
== Mirroring DockerHub

If you run a private registry internal to your company, you can https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/[optionally mirror DockerHub]. Your private registry will download and cache any images that your users reference from the public DockerHub. You must https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror[configure your Docker daemon to make use of mirroring].

[id="using-docker-in-workspaces"]
== Using Docker in workspaces

To allow your users to work with projects that have their own container images and Docker build capabilities inside of their workspaces, you must configure the workspaces to work with Docker. Following are the three options to configure the workspaces:

* Activate Docker privileged mode where your user workspaces have access to the host. Update your `che.env` to allow all Che workspace machines and containers to have privileged rights:
+
----
CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=true;
----

* Configure Che workspaces to mount the host Docker daemon socket file. Update your `che.env` to allow all Che workspaces to mount their host daemon when starting:
+
----
CHE_WORKSPACE_VOLUME=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock;
----

* Configure the Docker daemon to listen to the TCP socket and specify the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in the workspace machine. Each host environment will have different network topology and configuration. The following is an example.
+
To configure your Docker daemon to listen on TCP:
+
. Add the following to your Docker configuration file (on Ubuntu, the file is located at `/etc/default/docker`. For location of the Docker configuration file for your OS, see the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/[Docker documentation]). Listen using the default unix socket on a specific IP address on the host. This varies depending on your host OS.
+
----
# dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
----
+
Verify that the Docker API is responding at: `http://$IP:2375/containers/json`.
+
. Export the `DOCKER_HOST` variable in your workspace. You can do this in the terminal or make it permanent by adding `ENV DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$IP:2375` to a workspace recipe; here, `$IP` is the IP address of the Docker daemon machine.
+
On a workspace machine:
+
----
$ docker -H tcp://$IP:2375 ps
----
+
or:
+
----
$ export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://$IP:2375"
$ docker ps
----

These three options allow user workspaces to perform `docker` commands from within their workspace to create and work with containers that will be outside the workspace. This means that your users' workspaces are now equivalent to their personal computers where they would normally perform the `docker build` and `docker run` commands.

You must ensure that your user workspaces are powered from a stack that has Docker installed inside of it. Che's default Docker recipe images do not have Docker installed, but you can build your own image.

// [TODO: link to custom stack authoring].


[id="development-mode"]
== Debugging in development mode

You can debug the Che binaries that are running within the Che server. You can debug either the binaries that are included within the `eclipse/che-server` image that you download from DockerHub or you can mount a local Che Git repository to debug binaries built in a local assembly. By using local binaries, Che developers can perform a rapid edit-build-run cycle without having to rebuild Cheâ€™s Docker images.

To activate development mode, pass the `--debug` argument to any command on the CLI.

To activate development mode with embedded binaries:

----
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                      -v <local-path>:/data \
                         eclipse/che:<version> [COMMAND] --debug
----

You can replace the binaries in your local image with local binaries by mounting the Che Git repository to `:/repo` in your `docker run` command.

----
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                      -v <local-path>:/data \
                      -v <local-repo>:/repo \
                         eclipse/che:<version> [COMMAND] --debug
----

Optionally, you can use your local binaries in production mode by mounting `:/repo` without passing the `--debug` argument. Files from two locations from your Che source repository will be used instead of those in the image:

* During the `che config` phase, the source repositoryâ€™s `/dockerfiles/init/modules` and `/dockerfiles/init/manifests` will be used instead of the ones that are included in the `eclipse/che-init` container.

* During the `che start` phase, a local assembly from `assembly/assembly-main/target/` is mounted into the `eclipse/che-server` runtime container. You must run the `mvn clean install` on the `assembly/assembly-main/` directory prior to activating development mode.

Mounting `:/repo` will also make use of your repositoryâ€™s Puppet manifests and other files (replacing those that are stored within the `eclipse/che-server` base image). To only mount a new set of assemblies and ignore the other items in a repository, mount `:/assembly` to a directory that is the base of a binary. Mounting a `.tgz` file is not supported as yet.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                      -v __<local-path>__:/data \
                      -v __<local-assembly-directory>__:/assembly \
                         eclipse/che:__<version>__ _[COMMAND]_
----

To activate JPDA suspend mode for debugging Che server initialization, add the following in the `che.env` file:

----
CHE_DEBUG_SUSPEND=true
----

To change the Che debug port, add the following in the `che.env` file:

----
CHE_DEBUG_PORT=8000
----

[id="production-mode"]
== Building images in production mode

To build your own `INIT` and `SERVER` images to have custom configuration and binaries, take the following steps:

. Clone the https://github.com/eclipse/che[Che repository].

. Copy the `dockerfiles` directory to the root of your custom assembly. 

. Configure your Che server:

.. To have no custom configuration in your custom Che server, build the Che server image by executing the following command:
+
----
$ dockerfiles/build.sh
----
+
.. Tag the resulted image as needed.

.. To customize the configuration for your custom Che server and to allow users to override these custom configuration, in the `che.env` file, build your own `INIT` image with a custom https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/dockerfiles/init/manifests/che.env[`che.env`] file.

. Start the custom binaries.
+
----
$ docker run -ti -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                 -v /local/data/path:/data \
                 -e "IMAGE_CHE=your/che-server" \
                 -e "IMAGE_INIT=your/init-image" eclipse/che::{{site.latest_6_x_version}} start'
----

You have built `IMAGE_CHE` in `dockerfiles/che` and `IMAGE_INIT` is the one from `dockerfiles/init`.

[id="docker-unix-socket-mounting-vs-tcp-mode"]
== Docker Unix socket mounting vs TCP mode

The `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` command is used for mounting a Unix socket, so that when a process inside the container communicates with the Docker daemon, the process is redirected to the same socket on the host system.

However, peculiarities of file systems and permissions may make it impossible to invoke Docker processes from inside a container. If this happens, the Che startup scripts will print an error about being unable to reach the Docker daemon with guidance on how to resolve the issue.

An alternative solution is to run the Docker daemon in TCP mode on the host and export the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in the container. You can make the Docker daemon listen on both Unix sockets and TCP. On the host running the Docker daemon, run the following commands:

. Set this environment variable and restart the Docker daemon.
+
----
DOCKER_OPTS=" -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
----
+
. Verify that the Docker API is responding at the following address: `http://localhost:2375/info`.

. Run the Che container with the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable set to the IP address of the `docker0` or the `eth0` network interface. If `docker0` is running on 1.1.1.1, run the following command:
+
----
$ docker run -ti -e DOCKER_HOST=tcp://1.1.1.1:2375 \
                 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                 -v ~/Documents/che-data1:/data eclipse/che:{{site.latest_6_x_version}} start
----
+
. Alternatively, you can save this environment variable in the `che.env` file and restart Che.

[id="proxiesfirewallsports"]
== Installing Che behind a proxy

To install and operate Che behind a proxy, take the following steps:

. Configure each physical nodeâ€™s Docker daemon with proxy access.

. Optionally, to restrict the users' Internet access, override the workspace proxy settings for them.

. Before starting Che, configure the https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#/http-proxy[Docker daemon for proxy access]. When installing Che while having Docker for Windows or Docker for macOS installed on your desktop, these utilities have a GUI in their settings that let you set the proxy settings directly.

. Ensure that your `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` that you set in the Docker daemon have a protocol and port number. Ensure that you provide a fully qualified proxy location.

If you configure `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` in your Docker daemon, Che adds `localhost,127.0.0.1,CHE_HOST` to your `NO_PROXY` value; here, `CHE_HOST` is the DNS or IP address. We recommend that you add the short and long form DNS entry to your Dockerâ€™s `NO_PROXY` setting if it is not already set.

The following is an example of adding some values to the `che.env` file that contain some proxy overrides. You can optionally modify these with overrides.

----
CHE_HTTP_PROXY=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CHE_HTTPS_PROXY=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CHE_NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,<YOUR_CHE_HOST>
CHE_HTTP_PROXY_FOR_WORKSPACES=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CHE_HTTPS_PROXY_FOR_WORKSPACES=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CHE_NO_PROXY_FOR_WORKSPACES=localhost,127.0.0.1,<YOUR_CHE_HOST>

The last three entries are injected into workspaces created by your users. This gives your users access to the Internet from within their workspaces. You can comment out these entries to disable access. If that access is turned off, the default templates with source code fail to be created in workspaces as those projects are cloned from GitHub. Your workspaces are still functional and only  template cloning is prevented.

On Linux, a firewall may block inbound connections from within Docker containers to your localhost network. As a result, the workspace agent is unable to ping the Che server. You can check for a firewall and configure it to allow ther required connections.

Firewalls typically cause traffic problems when starting a new workspace. There are certain network configurations where we direct networking traffic between workspaces and Che through external IP addresses that can flow through routers or firewalls. If ports or protocols are blocked, certain functions will be unavailable.

== Running Che behind a firewall

Check whether required ports are open and, if necessary, configure the firewall to keep the ports open.

[id="configuring-firewall-on-linux"]
=== Configuring firewall on Linux

. Check if a firewall is running:
+
----
# systemctl status firewalld
----
+
. Check the list of open ports, and verify that ports `8080/tcp` and `32768-65535/tcp` are open:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --list-ports
----
+
. Optionally, open ports on your local firewall. For example:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
----
+ 
Use this command to open other ports, too.

[id="configuring-firewall-on-macos"]
=== Configuring firewall on macOS

. Verify that ports `8080/tcp` and `32768`--`65535/tcp` are open:
+
----
$ nmap -Pn -p T:8080,T:32768-65535 localhost
----
+
. If a port is closed, open it by editing the `/etc/pf.conf` file. For example, to open port `8080` for TCP for all interfaces, add the following line to the file:
+
----
pass in proto tcp from any port to any port 8080
----
. Test the settings:
+
----
# pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf
----
+
Restart the firewall: *System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Turn Off Firewall*.

[id="configuring-firewall-on-windows"]
== Configuring firewall on Windows

There are many third-party firewall services. Different versions of Windows also have different firewall configurations. The built-in Windows firewall can be configured in the *Control Panel* under *System and Security*:

. In the left pane, right-click *Inbound Rules*, and then click *New Rule* in the action pane.

. In the *Rule Type* dialog box, select *Port*, and click *Next*.

. In the *Protocol and Ports* dialog box, select *TCP*.

. Select specific local ports, enter the port number to be opened, and click *Next*.

. In the *Action* dialog box, select *Allow the Connection*, and click *Next*.

. In the *Name* dialog box, type a name and description for this rule, and click *Finish*.

[id="limiting-che-ports"]
== Limiting Che ports

Eclipse Che uses Docker to power its workspaces. Docker uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port[ephemeral port range] when exposing ports for services running in the container. So when a Tomcat server is started on port `8080` inside a Che workspace, Docker automatically selects an available port from the ephemeral range at runtime to map to that Tomcat instance.

Docker will select its ports from anywhere in the ephemeral range. To reduce the size of the ephemeral range to improve security you can do so. Note that each Che workspace will use at least two ports and, additionally, ports are required for the services that the user adds to their workspace.

Limiting the ephemeral range can only be done at the host level. To read more about it and some of the risks in doing so, see the http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral_ports.html[Ephemeral Port Range].

To change the ephemeral range:

* On Linux, see http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral_ports.html#Linux[changing ephemeral ports on Linux].

* On Windows, see http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral_ports.html#Windows[changing epemeral ports on Windows].
