== Introduction

Eclipse Che is a platform that can be extended by:

* adding client side plugins that bring new menus, panels and other UI components, link:ide-extensions-gwt.html[authored in GWT]
* adding link:server-side-extensions.html[server side components and agents] that get deployed to a workspace machines
* adding support of link:spi_overview.html[new infrastructure]
* enable language tooling via link:language-servers.html[Language Servers]

On top of that Eclipse Che can be integrated into other platforms since it exposes link:rest-api.html[REST APIs] for all server side components which makes it possible to create on demand workspaces serving needs of CI, support, issue tracking and other systems.
