== Understanding Che Assemblies?

An assembly is a Maven module that produces a build artifact. In case of https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/assembly[Eclipse Che], this is either a `.war` with `jars` in it, or a Tomcat assembly, which is a Tomcat web server with custom configuration and artifacts, copied to `webapps`. The following are Eclipse Che assemblies:

[width="100%",cols="61%,39%",options="header",]
|===
|Che Assembly |What Is Included
|`assembly-ide-war` |GWT plugins that will be compiled into a new browser IDE as JavaScript
|`assembly-wsagent-war` |Java plugins that will run within a workspace agent, deployed as `.war` artifact with numerous jars in it
|`assembly-wsagent-server` |Packages workspace agent into a Tomcat that is then launched in a machine
|`assembly-wsmaster-war` |Java plugins that will run within Che core server - master
|`assembly-main` |Packages all Che modules (including those listed above) into a final Tomcat bundle
|===

[id="assembly-ide-war"]
== assembly-ide-war

A successful build of this module produces an `ide.war` file, which is then deployed with Tomcat (produced by `assembly-main`) as a `ROOT.war` that contains dependencies packages as JAR files. It also contains the `_app` directory with JavaScript, CSS, and other resources that are loaded into the `IDE.html` file when the IDE is initialized.

This module inherits https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/da18cd1867210f87a6071ed65930fb47fb8bb775/ide/che-ide-gwt-app/pom.xml[`che-ide-gwt-app`] that it its turn has https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/5a6d3910b268feb3c4e67c2ff9aa5640410bf777/ide/che-ide-full/pom.xml[`che-ide-full`] in dependencies. So, `che-ide-full` is where all of the client side plugin dependencies are declared.

However, if you build a custom assembly and your plugin provides client side changes, it is root pom.xml of *assembly-ide-war* that dependencies should be added to. See: link:ide-extensions-gwt.html[IDE Extensions].

This is the module that is most often extended with custom plugins.

[id="assembly-wsagent-war"]
== assembly-wsagent-war

The build artifact of this module contains all server-side plugins components packaged as JAR files. Root `pom.xml` contains dependencies to all plugins that get deployed with the workspace agent, and this is where dependencies to custom plugins should be added. Once built, `assembly-wsagent-war` is copied to `webapps` of ws-agent Tomcat as `ROOT.war`. This is the module that is most often extended with custom plugins.

[id="assembly-wsagent-server"]
== assembly-wsagent-server

This module packages `ROOT.war` into Tomcat’s `webapps` and adds configuration files. This Tomcat is packaged as a `tar.gz` archive that is then placed into main Tomcat produced by the `assembly-main` build.

[id="assembly-wsmaster-war"]
== assembly-wsmaster-war

The core of Che platform as a workspace server that includes link:rest-api.html[workspace API], user profile and settings, link:spi-implementation.html[implementation of runtime infrastructure]. Usually used as a dependency in custom assemblies, however, it is possible to extend it, for example, by providing support of a new infrastructure.

[id="assembly-main"]
== assembly-main

This is the main assembly that packages all Che components into a Tomcat server. These components include wsmaster as `api.war`, User Dashboard as `dashboard.war`, documentation - `docs.war` and Swagger UI - `swagger.war`, agents like terminal and ws-agent (those are packaged into `lib` directory in the root of the resulting archive where Che master picks them up and serves, thus making them downloadable for link:installers.html[installers]).

[id="custom-assemblies"]
== Custom Assemblies

You may build your own custom assembly of Che. To do so, there is no need to clone or copy the entire Che source code. All artifacts can be used as dependencies. Also, unlike assemblies in Che source code, custom assemblies can use minimal artifacts for server and client side.

See an https://github.com/che-samples/che-ide-server-extension[example] of a custom Che assembly that brings in two plug-ins - server- and client-side. You may clone this repository and use it as a basis for your custom Che assembly.

Note that this example uses core artifacts as dependencies both for https://github.com/che-samples/che-ide-server-extension/blob/master/assembly/assembly-ide-war/pom.xml#L31-L35[client]:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>che-ide-core</artifactId>
    <type>gwt-lib</type>
</dependency>
----

and https://github.com/che-samples/che-ide-server-extension/blob/master/assembly/assembly-wsagent-war/pom.xml#L22-L26[server side]:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>che-wsagent-core</artifactId>
    <type>war</type>
</dependency>
----

Core artifacts contain a bare minimum set of platform components and plugins to be able to create and start a workspace, create or import a project, open and edit files in the editor.

You may use full artifacts that include all standard Che plugins:

Client side:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>che-ide-full</artifactId>
    <type>gwt-lib</type>
</dependency>
----

You may include a full IDE artifact and exclude a particular plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.che.core</groupId>
      <artifactId>che-ide-full</artifactId>
      <exclusions>
         <exclusion>
            <artifactId>che-plugin-product-info</artifactId>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.che.plugin</groupId>
         </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<build>
    <plugins>
       <plugin>
          <groupId>org.eclipse.che.core</groupId>
          <artifactId>che-core-gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
          <executions>
             <execution>
                <goals>
                   <goal>process-excludes</goal>
                </goals>
             </execution>
          </executions>
       </plugin>
    </plugins>
 </build>
----

Server side:

[source,xml]
----

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che</groupId>
    <artifactId>assembly-wsagent-war</artifactId>
    <type>war</type>
</dependency>
----

These two `pom.xml` files are entrypoints to adding custom plugins. This assembly includes two plugins, which are declared in:

* https://github.com/che-samples/che-ide-server-extension/blob/master/pom.xml#L54-L64[root `pom.xml`] - artifact version defaults to project version. These dependencies need to be declared to follow dependency convergence rules in Che (i.e. all dependencies have to be declared either in Che `maven-depmgt-pom` or in a root pom of an assembly). `maven-depmgt-pom` parent brings a set of enforcer plug-ins, such as formatting, dependency management, source validation, and others.

[source,xml]

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>plugin-serverservice-server</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* https://github.com/che-samples/che-ide-server-extension/blob/master/assembly/assembly-ide-war/pom.xml#L36-L40[assembly-ide-war pom]:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>plugin-serverservice-ide</artifactId>
    <type>gwt-lib</type>
</dependency>
----
+
This way, your client-side plug-in is included in `ide.war`. We use https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html[Maven’s overlays feature] to package custom plug-ins into the resulting artifact.

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>plugin-serverservice-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Your custom plug-in packaged as a JAR file is automatically added to the inherited `wsagent` artifact if both are declared as dependencies in `pom.xml`. As a result, the final `.war` artifact will contain a custom JAR file.

[id="updating-assemblies"]
== Updating assemblies

In the `pom.xml` file, update both:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <artifactId>maven-depmgt-pom</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.che.depmgt</groupId>
    <version>6.0.0-M4</version>
</parent>
----

and

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <che.version>6.0.0-M4</che.version>
</properties>
----

Keep the versions consistent to avoid build failures and incompatibilities. It is also recommended to keep versions of own artifacts aligned with a parent version.

Now that you have got some knowledge about Che assemblies and own cloned a sample assembly, take a closer look at Eclipse Che link:ide-extensions-gwt.html[client] and link:server-side-extensions.html[server-side] plug-ins.
