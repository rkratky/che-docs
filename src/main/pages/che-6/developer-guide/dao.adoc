Data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an interface of persisting objects of some domain in some storage. It provides an API of storing data objects into a database without exposing any details about which database is used or, in general, any specific details about an actual way of persisting data. Eclipse Che persists the following objects:

* Users, user profile and preferences
* Accounts
* link:what-are-workspaces.html[Workspaces]
* link:factories-getting-started.html[Factories]
* link:stacks.html[Stacks]
* link:permissions.html[Permissions]
* link:installers.html[Installers]
* link:organizations.html[Organizations and members]

Examples of DAO in Che:

* https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-user/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/user/server/spi/UserDao.java[User DAO] and an example of its implementation https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-user/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/user/server/jpa/JpaUserDao.java[JpaUserDao]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/server/spi/WorkspaceDao.java[Workspace DAO] and an example of its implementation https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/server/jpa/JpaWorkspaceDao.java[JpaWorkspaceDao]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-factory/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/factory/server/spi/FactoryDao.java[Factory DAO] and an example of its implementation https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsmaster/che-core-api-factory/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/factory/server/jpa/JpaFactoryDao.java[JpaFactoryDao]

Eclipse Che uses http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] for single-user builds and PostgreSQL database in a multi-user flavor.
