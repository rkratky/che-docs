[id="currently-supported-dbs"]
== Currently Supported Databases
As of version 6.11, Eclipse Che currently supports following databases:

* H2 (version 1.4.196)
* PostgreSQL (version 9.6)

H2 database is used by default in Single-User Che, whereas postgresql is used for Multi-User installation.
Both of these have been tested with Selenium Integration tests, as well as TCK integration tests.

There is also experimental support of the MySQL DB - currently only TCK test are confirmed to be working without any major issues, but the whole product wasn't checked yet.

It is possible to connect own DB to datasource, and have TCK tests run on it, to ensure that DB can be used with Che's JPA code.

[id="datasource-components"]
== Datasource components
*JDBC Pool configuration*
Depending on Database used by Che, `JNDIDataSourceFactory` implementation will provide all the required JDBC pool connection configuration.
These properties can be overriden with Che configuration Environment Variables:

[width="100%",options="header",]
|===
|Che Environment Variable |JDBC Pool configuration property
|CHE_JDBC_USERNAME |username
|CHE_JDBC_PASSWORD	|password
|CHE_JDBC_URL	|url
|CHE_JDBC_DRIVER\__CLASS__NAME	|driverClassName
|CHE_JDBC_MAX__TOTAL	|maxTotal
|CHE_JDBC_MAX__IDLE	|maxIdle
|CHE_JDBC_MAX\__WAIT__MILLIS| maxWaitMillis
|===

(More about JDBC configuration properties at https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html)

*ExceptionHandler*
Database may sometimes produce different SQL exception, depending on the vendor.
As in Java code, and TCK it is expected, a custom ExceptionHandler implementaion may be created, that will allow to rethrow more common exception.
For example, in H2 and PostgreSQL, an exception may occur, when data couldn't be updated/stored due to unique constrain violation.
But as it will a vendor specific exception with different code, there are Custom `H2ExceptionHandler`/`PostgreSqlExceptionHandler` that will catch it, and throw instead a `DuplicateKeyException`, which is used across the codebase.

Exception handler has to be defined in persistence XML.

[id="test-compatibility-kit"]
== Test Compatibility Kit (TCK)
Test Compatibility kit is a set of integration tests that covers uses of essential DAO components, that are being run against real database.

List of Che modules that have TCK tests:

* che-core-api-user
* che-core-api-account
* che-core-api-installer
* che-core-api-ssh
* che-core-api-workspace
* che-core-api-workspace-activity
* infrastructure-kubernetes
* che-multiuser-machine-authentication (Multi-User Che)
* che-multiuser-api-organization (Multi-User Che)
* che-multiuser-api-permission (Multi-User Che)
* che-multiuser-api-resource (Multi-User Che)
* che-multiuser-permission-workspace (Multi-User Che)

Tests in these modules are executed on H2 Database during the build.
Also, each module packages tests into separate artifacts with `tests` classifier, which are meant to be used for their re-usage in other TCK tests running modules.

As an example of that, there are `postgresql-tck` and `che-multiuser-postgresql-tck` modules for running TCK tests on Postgres DB.

[id="cascade-removal-tests"]
== JPA Cascade Removal Tests

In Eclipse Che database schema, some objects have foreign keys reference on other objects.
Example: Account and workspaces, Permissions and Workspaces. To be able to correctly
remove such objects and avoid referential integrity problems Eclipse Che are using events mechanism.
For example, method in AccountManager that removes account sends a CascadeEvent, and Workspace DAO has a CascadeEventSubscriber that would listen to that event
and remove workspace at that time. In case if removal of workspace failed the whole transaction would be rolled back, because AccountManager method had a `@Transactional` annotation.

All that functionality is covered by "Cascade Removal Tests", that are located in `cascade-removal` and `che-multiuser-cascade-removal` modules.

[id="flyway-migration"]
== Flyway migration

Flyway framework is used to facilitate database schema initialization, as well as perform migrations.
It is configured to pick up scripts and apply them in order, according to versioning.
Some key configuration values are defined in che.properties:


----
db.schema.flyway.baseline.enabled=true                      #
db.schema.flyway.baseline.version=5.0.0.8.1                 #
db.schema.flyway.scripts.prefix=                            #
db.schema.flyway.scripts.suffix=.sql                        #
db.schema.flyway.scripts.version_separator=__               #
db.schema.flyway.scripts.locations=classpath:che-schema     #
----

Che DB Schema artifacts have

Taking a look at the sample structure:

----
che-schema/
    5.0.0-M1/
        1__init.sql
    5.0.0-M2
        1__rename_tables.sql
        2__insert_predefined_data.sql
        postgresql/
            2__insert_predefined_data.sql
subproject-schema/
    5.0.0-M1/
        0.1__before_init_main.sql
        1.1__init_subproject.sql
    5.0.0-M2
        2.1__create_additional_tables.sql
----

Location directory
The main root directory for scripts (in this example, `che-schema` and `subproject-schema` is used as location names for Flyway.
There can be multiple locations (artifacts) with scripts, and Flyway can be configured with property to search for such locations in classpath

db.schema.flyway.scripts.locations=classpath:che-schema,classpath:subproject-schema

* Version directory*

There are version directories under the `che-schema` like 5.0.0 or 5.0.0-M1 these directories contain
scripts for specific versions
SQL scripts will be placed under project version directories line 1.init.sql or 1.rename_fields.sql
The naming of scripts is pretty simple: the first digit in the name is a script version in a project versions (it's `1` in `1__init.sql`)
then description of changes (if necessary) init in 1__init.sql and then the file extension .sql in 1__init.sql

Note, that in this example, as well as in current Che schema, scripts numbers start from 1, but it is possible to use 0.
This can be useful when script has to be run before the first script in superschema.

*Vendor specific script*

There is a directory in 5.0.0-M2 called `postresql` if current database provider is posgresql then
the script from 5.0.0-M1/posgresql/2.add_workspace_constraint.sql will be used instead of 5.0.0-M1/2.add_workspace_constraint.sql, so basically if the same script name is provided in provider-specific directory then this script will be used instead

So, the order of applying scripts be as following
[width="100%",options="header",]
|===
|db version |script name	|location	|picked vendor specific
|5.0.0.1.0.1	|0.1__before_init_main.sql	|subproject-schema	|no
|5.0.0.1.1 |1__init.sql	|che-schema	|no
|5.0.0.1.1.1	|1.1__init_subproject.sql	|subproject-schema	|no
|5.0.0.2.1	|1__rename_tables.sql	|che-schema	|no
|5.0.0.2.2	|2__insert_predefined_data.sql	|che-schema	|yes
|5.0.0.2.2.1	|2.1__create_new_tables.sql	|subproject-schema	|no
|===

[id="pg-trgm"]
== pg_trgm
Postgres Trigram extension is used for more optimised search of similar string https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/pgtrgm.html

in Che it is used for a faster search for similar email and names, and enabled with a vendor specific migration script:
```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX index_user_lower_email ON usr USING GIN (LOWER(email) gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX index_user_lower_name ON usr USING GIN (LOWER(name) gin_trgm_ops);
```

== Contributor guidelines
*Creating a module to run TCK on a custom DB*

In order to run TCK for a custom database, a maven module should be created with following components:

- configured `docker-maven-plugin` to run an image with database;
- a Guice module that extends `TckModule` which will be responsible for establishing connection with DataSource, binding all required implementations of JPA entities and repositories;
- a file in src/test/resources/META-INF/services named `org.eclipse.che.commons.test.tck.TckModule`. In it, there must be defined a name of the mentioned TckModule implementaion;
- include all dependency artifacts with TCK tests (see list of Che modules above);
- include artifact with DB Driver;
- include artifact with Che SQL schema. Note, that your database may not be fully compatible with existing Che SQL schema, so you might gonna have to create a separate maven module to add additional vendor specific scripts ( See "Flyway Migration" for the information on how to add such scripts);
- add persistence.xml file or use PersistTestModuleBuilder helper class to create one programmatically in `TckModule` implementation;

Note, that to contribute the module to Eclipse repository, one must create an Eclipse CQ for Database, its drivers and other possible dependencies.
As these artifacts are used only for building and testing purposes, the type of CQ will be "works with". See https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-third-party-workswith
