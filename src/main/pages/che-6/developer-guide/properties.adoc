== Referencing Properties in Extensions

You can reference properties in Che extensions that you author. Configuration parameters may be injected with a constructor or directly in the fields. The parameter of the field must be annotated with `@javax.inject.Named`. The value of the annotation is the name of the property. For example, if the configuration property is: `data_file:/home/user/storage` then in your extension code:

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
  ...
  @Inject
  public MyClass(@Named("data_file") File storage) {
      ...
  }
}
----

or

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
  @Inject
  @Named("data_file")
  private File storage;
  ...
}
----

All system properties and environment variables may be injected into your extensions with prefixes `sys.` and `env.`, respectively. So, for example, environment variable `HOME` name must be `env.HOME`. Here is an example of how to inject the value of system property `java.io.tmpdir` and value of environment variable `HOME`.

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
  @Inject
  public MyClass(@Named("sys.java.io.tmpdir") File tmp, @Named("env.HOME") File home) {
      ...
  }
}
----

Any value can be converted into a `java.lang.String` Java type. You can also directly convert properties to the following Java types: * `boolean` * `byte` * `short` * `int` * `long` * `float` * `double` * `java.net.URI` * `java.net.URL` * `java.io.File` * `String[]` (value is a comma separated string)

[id="property-aliases"]
== Property Aliases

Sometimes a developer may need to change property name but support old names as well for the sake of backward compatibility. If this is the case, there is https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/che_aliases.properties[aliases file] where you can map new property name to old ones:

----
current_name=old_name, very_old_name
----

A few gotchas:

* current_name = current_value
* if `old_name` property exists it will be bound to the old_value, so `current_name = old_value` and `very_old_name = old_value`
* if `very_old_name` property exists it will be bound to `very_old_value`, so `current_name = very_old_value` and `old_name = very_old_value`

*IMPORTANT*: it is prohibited to use a different name for the same property on the same level. From the example above, you can use environment property `CHE_CURRENT_NAME` and `CHE_OLD_NAME`. However, you can use it on a different level, for instance, environment property and system property.

[id="properties-and-environment-variables"]
== Properties and Environment Variables

Naming conventions:

* dots in properties separate components (in case of env vars it is a *single* underscore)
* underscores in properties separate words in a single component item (in case of env vars it is a *double underscore*)

Example:

----
che.component1.sub_component_2_mb -> CHE_COMPONENT1_SUB__COMPONENT__2__MB

where MB is unit of measurement in case when property is a number
----

Environment variables have a *higher priority* over properties, so if both are set, value of an environment variable will be used. Property can only be overridden, if it starts with `che.`

[id="workspace-extension-properties"]
== Workspace Extension Properties

Each workspace is a separate runtime, and has at least one development agent that runs as a miniaturized Che server within the workspace. That agent has its own properties that can be configured as well. If you are authoring custom workspace extensions that are deployed within Cheâ€™s agent in the workspace, you can customize.
