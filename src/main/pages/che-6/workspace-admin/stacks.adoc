[id="stack-overview"]
== Stack overview

A stack is a link:workspace-data-model.html[workspace configuration] template. Stacks are used to create workspaces in the *User Dashboard*. The stack includes meta-information such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification.  You can filter stacks by machine type and scope. The type is either single machine or multi machine.  You can also search for a stack by keyword. Stacks are displayed in the *User Dashboard* on the *Create a workspace* page.

See the link:creating-starting-workspaces.html[Creating and starting workspaces user guide] for more information.

== Importing community supported stacks and applications

Che includes some stacks and sample applications that are pre-configured and tested. Stacks that are contributed by the Che community are not tested. Community stacks are located in the https://github.com/che-samples/community-stacks[community stacks GitHub repository].

Each directory has `${technology}-stack.json` and `${technology}-samples.json`.

To import a stack, follow these steps:

.  Copy the content of the JSON files.
.  Go to `${CHE_HOST}/swagger/#!/stack/createStack`.
.  Paste the content of the JSON file to the *body* field.
.  Click the *Try it out* button.

You can choose a different name or ID when there is a conflict with the stack ID or name.

For a multi-user setup, you can make your stack available for a particular user or all users in the system.  See link:#stack-sharing-and-system-stacks[stack sharing] for more information.

To import sample applications, move `*-stacks.json` files to:

* `${LOCAL_STORAGE}/instance/data/templates` for Docker infrastructure.
* `${mount-path-of-che-data-volume}/templates` for OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. You need administrator privileges to get the host path and to access the host directory. Also, the new JSON files have the same permissions as the original `samples.json` file.

You can find Dockerfiles for all stacks in the https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles[Che Dockerfiles repository].

[id="sharing-stacks-and-system-stacks"]
== Sharing stacks and system stacks

You can share stacks with selected users or with all users in the system if you have system privileges.  You share stacks by making REST calls.

To share stacks with users:

* Log in as administrator
* Go to `/swagger/#!/stack/searchStacks` to get a list of all stacks. You may filter search by tags.
* Find your stack by name and get its ID.
* The next API to use is: `/swagger/#!/permissions`
* Find the below POST method:

image::workspaces/stack_permissions.png[]

* Use the following JSON file and replace `${STACK_ID}` with an actual ID:

[source,json]
----
{
"userId": "*",
  "domainId": "stack",
  "instanceId": "${STACK_ID}",
  "actions": [
    "read",
    "search"
  ]
}
----

If you get 204, all the users in the system see the stack. To share a stack with a particular user, get the user's ID and use it instead of `*` in the JSON file.

The administrator can remove pre-configured stacks and replace them with custom stacks. The administrator can also remove permissions from stacks.  You can create stacks either in the user dashboard or by using any REST client. You can use Swagger (`$CHE_HOST:$CHE_PORT/swagger`) to bundle with Che.

[id="loading-stacks"]
== Loading stacks

Stacks are loaded from a JSON file that is packaged into resources of a special component that is deployed with the workspace master. This JSON file is not exposed to users.   You can perform stack management using REST APIs in the *User Dashboard*.

When a user first starts Che, stacks are loaded from a JSON file only when the database is initialized. This is the default policy that can be changed.   To keep getting stack updates with the new Che stacks, set `CHE_PREDEFINED_STACKS_RELOADONSTART=true` in `che.env`. When set to `true`, `stacks.json` is used to update Che database each time the Che server starts. This means Che gets all the stacks in `stacks.json` and uploads the stacks to a database. This allows you to keep existing custom stacks and get stack updates from new Che releases. New and edited stacks that have fixes in the stack definition are merged in with the other stacks. 

Name conflicts are possible. A name conflict happens when a new Che version provides a stack with a name that already exists in the database.
