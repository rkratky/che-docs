[id="workspace-data-model-projects"]
== Projects

image::workspaces/ws_projects.png[]

The project object structure has the `source.location` and `source.type` parameters. There are two importer types: `git` and `zip`. New location types can be provided by custom plugins, such as `svn`.

Incorrectly configured projects or projects missing sources are marked with error codes and messages explaining the error. In the example above, the project does not have errors and mixins.

A mixin adds additional behaviors to the project, the IDE panels, and menus. Mixins are reusable across any project type. To define the mixins to add to a project, specify an array of strings, with each string containing the identifier for the mixin.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Mixin ID |Description
|`git` |Initiates the project with a Git repository. Adds Git-menu functionality to the IDE. To add a mixin to the project, create a new project and then initialize a Git repository.
|`pullrequest` |Enables pull-request workflow where a server handles the local and remote branching, forking, and pull-request issuance. Pull requests generated from within the server have another Factory placed into the comments of pull requests that a PR reviewer can consume. Adds contribution panel to the IDE. Set this mixin to use attribute values for `project.attributes.local_branch` and `project.attributes.contribute_to_branch`.
|===

The `pullrequest` mixin requires additional configuration from the `attributes` object of the project.

The `project` object can include `source.parameters`, which is a map that can contain additional parameters. Example:Â related to project importer.

|===
|Parameter name |Description
|`skipFirstLevel` |Used for projects with type `zip`. When value is 'true', the first directory inside ZIP will be omitted.

[id="commands"]
== Commands

Commands can be both tied to a workspace and an individual project. In the example below, a command is saved to workspace configuration.

The followling image shows ways to save commands in the project configuration.

[id="runtime"]
== Runtime

A runtime object is created when a workspace is in a running state. Runtime returns server URLs, internal or external, depending on the server configuration. Interested clients, like the *User Dashboard* and the IDE, use these URLs.
