Environment variables are defined per machine. Depending on the infrastructure, they are added either to the container or the Kubernetes pod definition. You can add, edit, and remove environment variables either in the *User Dashboard* or directly in the workspace machine configuration.

The following is an example of an environment variable:

[source,json]

"env": {
  "key": "value"
    }

You can use environment variables in applications running in a workspace, in link:commands-ide-macro.html[commands], and in the terminal. The Che server also adds some environment variables that a user does not control, although they are available to use. For example, they can be used as an API endpoint or workspace ID.

The following shows how to add a new environment variable:
