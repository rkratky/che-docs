[id="what-are-installers"]
== What are installers?

Installers are scripts that are added into machines in a runtime. Once running, installers:

. Prepare the environment and download dependencies for a particular software or tool.
. Install chosen software and dependencies.
. Launch software and tools with particular arguments and modes that provide extra functionality for a workspace.

Installers are typically language servers and tools that provide features such as SSH access to a workspace machine. You can find a complete list of available installers in the *Workspace details > Installers* tab.

The following is an example of installers:

----
"installers": [
    "org.eclipse.che.exec",
    "org.eclipse.che.terminal",
    "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent",
    "org.eclipse.che.ssh"
        ]

[id="how-installers-work"]
== How installers work

Installers are saved in a configuration file that a link:what-are-workspaces.html#bootstrapper[bootstrapper] uses to execute jobs. An installer script works exactly the same way as other shell scripts in Linux. The Che server checks if the launched process is running.

Some installers activate special agents, such as the workspace, terminal, and execution agents.  If a workspace agent fails to start, the workspace is treated as if it has been started but the IDE is not usable. If the execution agent fails, the *commands* widget is unavailable.


[id="what-happens-when-enabling-and-disabling-installers"]
== What happens when enabling and disabling installers 

You can enable or disable installers per machine by using the *User Dashboard* or by updating the workspace machine configuration. When an installer is enabled, the bootstrapper executes an installer script after the workspace has started.

The following shows installers that are enabled and disabled:

[id="troubleshooting-installer-failures"]
== Troubleshooting installer failures

=== Permission denied failure

Installers run as if a user in the container has `sudoers` privileges. If the user does not have the privileges, the installer fails with `permission denied` issues.

This problem can occur with OpenShift when a pod is run by a user with no permissions to use `sudo` or to access or modify resources on the file system. 

In most cases, this problem can be solved by rebuilding the base image so that it already has all of the dependencies for particular agents that an installer activates. 

=== Permission to files and directories failures

Another possible issue can be with permissions to files and directories. For example, an installer may need to write to the https://github.com/eclipse/che-dockerfiles/blob/master/recipes/stack-base/centos/Dockerfile#L45-L57[user home directory].

[id="installer-registry-and-rest-api"]
== Installer registry and REST API

Che installers are stored in the Installer Registry. They can be viewed and edited through the Installer Registry REST API:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Path | HTTP Method | Description
|`/installer` |GET | Get installers
|`/installer/{id}/version` |GET | Get versions of installers by given id
|`/installer/orders` |GET | Get installers, ordered by their dependencies
|`/installer/` |POST | Add installer to the registry
|`/installer/{key}` |PUT | Update installer in the registry
|`/installer/{key}` |DELETE | Remove installer from the registry
|===
