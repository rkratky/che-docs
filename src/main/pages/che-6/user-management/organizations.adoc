== Organizations in Eclipse Che

Organizations allow administrators to group Eclipse Che users and allocate resources. The system administrator controls and allocates resources and permissions within the administrator dashboard.

[id="roles-in-an-organization"]
=== Roles in an organization

A user can have the following roles in an organization:

Members:: Create workspaces, manage their own workspaces, and use any workspaces they have permissions for.
Administrators:: Manage the organization, members, resources, and sub-organization, and can edit settings.
System Administrators:: Create root organizations, manages resources, members and sub-organizations. System administrators have more permissions than the administrators and members. 

[id="root-organizations-and-sub-organizations"]
=== Root organizations and sub-organizations 

The top-level organizations are called root organizations.   Multiple root organizations can be created.  Any organization can have zero to a set number of sub-organizations.  Only the system administrator can create root organizations and manage the resources of the root organization. 

[id="creating-an-organization"]

[id="workspaces-in-organizations"]
=== Workspaces in organizations

A workspace is created inside of an organization and uses the resources of the organization. The workspace creator chooses the organization on the *Workspace Creation* page.  

[id="setting-email-notifications"]
=== Setting email notifications

To send notifications from the Che server when a user joins or leaves an organization, you can do either of the following:

Che does not have a built-in SMTP server by default. You may use any mail server.

For example, to send a notification email to your Gmail account, set the following environment variables:

----
CHE_MAIL_PORT=465
CHE_MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
CHE_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE=true
CHE_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true
