[id="permissions-overview"]
== Overview

Permissions are used to control the actions of users and establish a security model.  You can control resources managed by Che and allow certain actions by assigning permissions to users.

Permissions can be applied to the following:

* Workspace
* Organization
* Stack
* System

[id="workspace-permissions"]
== Workspace permissions

The user who creates a workspace is the workspace owner. The workspace owner has the following permissions by default:  `read`, `use`, `run`, `configure`, `setPermissions`, and `delete`. Workspace owners invite users into the workspace and control workspace permissions for each user.

The following permissions are associated with workspaces:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Permission |Description
|read |Allows reading the workspace configuration.
|use |Allows using a workspace and interacting with it.
|run |Allows starting and stopping a workspace.
|configure |Allows defining and changing the workspace configuration.
|setPermissions |Allows updating the workspace permissions for other users.
|delete |Allows deleting the workspace.
|===

[id="organization-permissions"]
== Organization permissions

An organization is a named set of users.

The following permissions are applicable to organizations:

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Permission |Description
|update |Allows editing of the organization settings and information.
|delete |Allows deleting an organization.
|manageSuborganizations |Allows creating and managing sub-organizations.
|manageResources |Allows redistribution of an organization’s resources and defining the resource limits.
|manageWorkspaces |Allows creating and managing all the organization’s workspaces.
|setPermissions |Allows adding and removing users and updating their permissions.

[id="system-permissions"]
== System permissions

System permissions control aspects of the whole Che installation.

The following permissions are applicable to the organization:

[cols=",",options="header",]

|setPermissions |Allows updating the permissions for users on the system.

|monitorSystem |Allows for accessing endpoints used for monitoring the state of the server.
|===

All system permissions will be granted to the administration user configured with the pass:[`CHE_SYSTEM_ADMIN__NAME`] property (the default is `admin`).
This happens at Che Server start. If the user is not present in the Che user database, it happens after the user's login.

[id="super-privileged-mode"]
== Super-privileged mode

The `manageSystem` permission can be extended to provide a super-privileged mode. This allows the user to perform advanced actions on any resources managed by the system. You can read and stop any workspaces with the `manageSystem` permission and assign permissions to users as needed.

The super-privileged mode is disabled by default. You can change to super-privileged mode by configuring the pass:[`CHE_SYSTEM_SUPER__PRIVILEGED__MODE`] variable to `true` in the `che.env` file.
