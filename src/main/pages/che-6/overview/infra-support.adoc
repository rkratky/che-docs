== Introduction

Eclipse Che runs on several infrastructures and container engines:

* Docker
* OpenShift: *https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)]*, *https://www.openshift.com/features/index.html[OpenShift Online (OSO)]*, *https://access.redhat.com/products/openshift-dedicated-red-hat/[OpenShift Dedicated (OCD)]*, *https://www.openshift.org/minishift/[MiniShift]*
* Kubernetes

== Docker versus OpenShift for running Che

Che on Docker is not scalable because you cannot add more nodes to run workspaces.Even if you have a node with lots of resources, you can face problems with many containers residing on one node.  A potential problem is that the instance can be unresponsive when it has a large number of running containers with heavy processes running in them. This affects the workspace master and all running workspaces.

The follow features are available on both Docker and OpenShift:

*Root Access:* You can have root access in workspace containers, which allows you to run system services and to install software at runtime.

*Privileged Containers:* You can run workspace containers in a link:docker-config.html#privileged-mode[privileged mode].


The following features are only available on OpenShift:

*HTTPS support:*

HAProxy runs in an OpenShift cluster and creates secure routes.

*Scalability:*

You can add nodes depending on the demand to run workspaces. OpenShift schedules workspaces to available nodes.

*Health Checks:*

OpenShift restarts failed deployments and offers health checks for pods. This can significantly minimize the effect of infrastructure outages.

*Persistent Preview URLs:*

You can access applications and processes in Che workspaces.  Che creates services and routes that are persistent URLs.
