== Overview

In CHE we use http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification[JSON-RPC] for asynchronous communication between clients and servers. JSON-RPC is asymmetric by nature so in order to be able to information independently we use duplex approach where both sides (clients and servers) can act both as a JSON-RPC server and as JSON-RPC client. To make it clear, clients (e.g. IDE) can send JSON-RPC requests (acting as JSON-RPC client) and receive requests (acting as JSON-RPC server) and servers (e.g. workspace master or workspace agent) can do the same.

[id="send-a-json-rpc-request"]
== Send a JSON-RPC request

To send request you can use https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/core/che-core-api-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/core/jsonrpc/commons/RequestTransmitter.java[`org.eclipse.che.api.core.jsonrpc.commons.RequestTransmitter`], the most basic use case (actual for both client and server sides) looks quite simple:

[source,java]
----
transmitter
         .newRequest()
         .endpointId(endpointId)
         .methodName(method)
         .paramsAsDto(dto)
         .sendAndReceiveResultAsDto(dtoClass)
         .onSuccess((result) -> {})
         .onFailure((jsonRpcError) -> {});
----

*endpointId* - in common sense can be an arbitrary *`String`* identifier that allows to distinguish endpoints. Please note that for server sides these endpoints are statically defined as constants: `"ws-agent"` for workspace agent and `"ws-master"` for workspace master for example, while for clients it is a dynamic identifier because clients are dynamic by their nature.

*method* - method name corresponds to it’s definition in JSON-RPC protocol specification. In Che we use the following naming convention: method name in most cases consists of two parts separated be slash - scope and action. For example `project/create` where `project` is the scope and `create` is the action.

*dto* - value of parameters passed (in our example it is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object[DTO]), please note that though JSON-RPC protocol specification requires parameters either as json objects or arrays, you can use single primitives here as well and they will be automatically converted to a singleton array.

*dtoClass* - class of a result that will be contained within the response to our request

*result* - result of our request (in our example it is of class *dtoClass*)

*jsonRpcError* - error object that contains information about the error if any happened, its structure corresponds to error defined in JSON-RPC protocol specification

Source code example of using of the transmitter can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsagent/che-core-api-debug/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/debugger/server/DebuggerJsonRpcMessenger.java#L76

[id="receive-a-json-rpc-request"]
== Receive a JSON-RPC request

To receive a request you can use https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/core/che-core-api-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/core/jsonrpc/commons/RequestHandlerConfigurator.java[`org.eclipse.che.api.core.jsonrpc.commons.RequestHandlerConfigurator`], the use case (actual for both sides):

[source,java]
----
configurator
         .newConfiguration()
         .methodName(method)
         .paramsAsDto(paramsDtoClass)
         .resultAsDto(resultDtoClass)
         .withFunction((endpointId, paramsDto) -> resultDto);
----

*method* - the name of JSON-RPC method that is to be handled by this configuration

*paramsDtoClass* - class of parameters that are passed in a JSON-RPC request (in our example it is a DTO)

*resultDtoClass* - class of result that is passed in a JSON-RPC response (in our example it is DTO)

*endpointId* - the identifier of an endpoint that sends the request that is handled by this configuration

*paramsDto* - the value of parameters passed

*resultDto* - the value of result passed

Source code example of using of the transmitter can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/wsagent/che-core-api-debug/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/debugger/server/DebuggerJsonRpcMessenger.java#L117

[id="client-endpoint-identification"]
== Client endpoint identification

In order to receive a cross sessional identifier clients (e.g. IDE) can use a https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/core/che-core-api-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/core/websocket/impl/WebsocketIdService.java[`org.eclipse.che.api.core.websocket.impl.WebsocketIdService`], otherwise client identifier will not be persisted between websocket sessions. The most common use case (client specific):

[source,java]
----
requestTransmitter
        .newRequest()
        .endpointId("ws-master")
        .methodName("websocketIdService/getId")
        .noParams()
        .sendAndReceiveResultAsString()
        .onSuccess(appContext::setApplicationWebsocketId);
----

Source code example of using websocket identification service can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/ide/che-core-ide-app/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/ide/jsonrpc/WsMasterJsonRpcInitializer.java#L134
