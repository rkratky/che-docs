Installing Chedir is extremely easy. Just link:docker-cli.html[get the Che CLI] and you have everything you need to run Chedir on any operating system. Docker and Git Bash (installed by Docker) are required for the Che CLI.

[id="backwards-compatibility"]
== Backwards Compatibility

Chedir requires Eclipse Che 4.7+. Chefiles are not supported to run on older versions of Che.

[id="upgrading"]
== Upgrading

You will automatically get newer versions of Chedir when you upgrade Eclipse Che. You can upgrade Eclipse Che with the CLI by `docker run -it --rm <DOCKER_PARAMETERS> eclipse/che:<version> upgrade`. If you want to use a particular version of Chedir you can set `CHE_VERSION` as an environment variable and Chedir will use that particular version. You can run multiple versions of Chedir at the same time.

[id="from-source"]
== From Source

Chedir is provided as a Docker container which you can run instead of using the CLI. The CLI captures your environmental information and invokes the container with the appropriate syntax.

----
# Mac / Linux
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
           -v "$PWD":"$PWD" --rm eclipse/che-dir \
           $PWD <init|up>

# Windows
# Replace $PWD to be the absolute path to the current directory.
# Use case-sensitive format with forward slashes: /c/Users/some_path/
