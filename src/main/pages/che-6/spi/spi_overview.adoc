[id="abstraction"]
== Abstraction

Che Workspace Runtime composed by set of running Machines can be deployed on top of any Infrastructure. Runtime is able to provide one or more Machines.

As defined in a link:what-are-workspaces.html[workspace model], a machine is termed as some set of hardware and|or software resources working under control of Operation System. Examples of such Infrastructure including:

* Running Physical Computers
* Virtual machines
* Linux Containers

Che Workspace Runtime *Service Provider Interface* (SPI) is a clean abstraction to allow pluggable Environment and Runtime Infrastructure.

It defines two kinds of contracts to be implemented in order to:

* describe Workspace Environment binding logical configuration of Machines along with implementation of a specific Recipe
* let particular Runtime Infrastructure start and stop resources associated with Workspace Runtime, such as Docker Containers, Kubernetes Pods, volumes etc.
* allow listening to infrastructure specific events, machines start/stop sequences, servers health checking thanks to asynchronous link:json-rpc.html[JSON-RPC messaging].

Strictly speaking, there are 2 kinds of SPI: one for Environment analyzing and transformation and another for applying effective environment and starting Workspace Runtime.

The reason of decoupling `InternalEnvironment` from Runtime Infrastructure SPI is that some types of Recipes can be understandable/supported for more than one Infrastructure.

[id="motivation"]
== Motivation

SPI is one of the main features of Che 6.

There are several reasons to implement it, main of which include:

* Big demand of using infractructures other than Docker, such as: OpenShift, Kubernetes, local machine which was too hard on Docker oriented implementation.
* Needs to have more flexibility with deploying different tools on different machines, not to be "dev-machine oriented".
* A client has to be better informed during Workspace starting, stopping and running including receiving detailed infrastructure specific events.
