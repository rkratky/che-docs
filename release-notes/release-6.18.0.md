## Quick Start

Che is a cloud IDE and containerized workspace server - get started on:

* Kubernetes ([single-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/kubernetes-single-user.html) or [multi-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/kubernetes-multi-user.html))
* OpenShift ([single-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/openshift-single-user.html) or [multi-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/openshift-multi-user.html))
* Docker ([single-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/docker-single-user.html) or [multi-user](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/docker-multi-user.html))
* Try Eclipse Che live at [https://che.openshift.io](https://che.openshift.io)

Learn more in our [documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/infra-support.html) and start using a shared Che server or local instance today.

## Add VueJS language support

Thank you to [@demsking](https://github.com/demsking) for a pull
request which adds support for [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) to the
[Web plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/plugins/plugin-web).
Vue.js is a Javascript framework for building user interfaces. This support
includes syntax highlighting and Intellisense.

## Improvements for Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) handling

![Ephemeral mode switch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1611939/51479083-f50b4580-1d95-11e9-9eb7-0b0e3351cda8.png)

This release contains a number of changes which improve PVC handling for
users. We have made it easier for users to use ephemeral storage for
workspaces by adding an option to enable ephemeral mode in the workspace
creation page. In addition, we have added the ability to define the PVC
strategy in the Kubernetes or OpenShift deployment scripts.

If you have ever had a workspace fail to start because of a PVC issue, you
know that it can sometimes be hard to find the root cause afterwards. In
this release, when there is an error related to a PVC, we can now send the
full log trace to the host platform (Kubernetes or OpenShift), making it
easier for the cluster administrator to diagnose storage-related issues.

* Get logs from PVC helper pods when job fails: https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/12514

## Support for mounting workspace source code in consistent location for plugin containers

Che plugins can now declare that they want the sources of the workspace projects available in their
containers.

In the `che-plugin.yaml` file, the plugin author can set the new `mountSources` attribute to `true` on
each container which should have access to the sources. Che will make sure that the volume with
the source code is mounted to the container. The mount location is consistent across all plugin
containers, which enables different plugins to cooperate and "talk" about the same files in the
projects. The project's source path is available in the `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable
during container startup and run time.

## Improved debugging of Che server on Kubernetes and Openshift

This is a feature aimed primarily at the developers of Che itself.

The `CHE_DEBUG_SUSPEND` environment variable now also works on Kubernetes and Openshift deployments
of Che server. Setting this flag to `true` and (re)starting a Che server deployment makes the server
wait for a connection from a debugger on port 8000 before starting up. This is invaluable for
debugging the server startup. 

To connect your local IDE to the server, you first need to forward the port so that you can use it
on `localhost`, e.g. on Openshift:

```bash
oc get pods
oc port-forward <CHE_POD> 5005:8000

```

where `<CHE_POD>` is the name of the che server pod obtained from `oc get pods`.

After this, you will be able to connect your Java debugger of choice to `localhost:5005` and
initiate a remote debugging session of the Che server.

On Kubernetes, simply exchange `oc` with `kubectl` in the example above.
