## Improvements in workspace idling diagnostics

Due to an improvement in Eclipse Che diagnostics of workspace activity, and better handling of
possible error conditions, we no longer log an unnecessary warning when workspace idling is disabled.

Concretely, in previous versions, if `CHE_LIMITS_WORKSPACE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` was set to a negative value,
a warning similar to the following is unnecessarily written to the log:

```
2019-02-13 13:19:15,527[ted-scheduler-2]  [WARN ] [a.w.a.WorkspaceActivityChecker 330]  - Found no expiration time on workspace 'workspace5w1v228zcl6sini5'. This was detected 1727206ms after the workspace has been recorded running which is suspicious. Please consider filing a bug report. To restore the normal function, the expiration time has been set to 1550062228321.
```

This has been fixed and should no longer be the case.
